<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>The Settlers, and Whence They Came.</h3>
</div>
<p>There were five of them, all told; three boys
and two men. I have mentioned the boys first
because there were more of them, and we shall
hear most from them before we have got through
with this truthful tale. They lived in the town
of Dixon, on the Rock River, in Lee County,
Illinois. Look on the map, and you will find
this place at a point where the Illinois Central
Railroad crosses the Rock; for this is a real town
with real people. Nearly sixty years ago, when
there were Indians all over that region of the
country, and the red men were numerous where
the flourishing States of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin
are now, John Dixon kept a little ferry at
the point of which I am now speaking, and it was
known as Dixon&#8217;s Ferry. Even when he was not
an old man, Dixon was noted for his long and
flowing white hair, and the Indians called him
Na-chu-sa, &#8220;the White-haired.&#8221; In 1832 the Sac
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
tribe of Indians, with their chief Black Hawk, rose
in rebellion against the Government, and then there
happened what is now called the Black Hawk war.</p>
<p>In that war many men who afterwards became
famous in the history of the United States were
engaged in behalf of the government. One of
these was Zachary Taylor, afterwards better known
as &#8220;Rough and Ready,&#8221; who fought bravely in the
Mexican war and subsequently became President
of the United States. Another was Robert Anderson,
who, at the beginning of the war of the Rebellion,
in 1861, commanded the Union forces in Fort
Sumter when it was first fired upon. Another was
Jefferson Davis, who, in the course of human
events, became President of the Southern Confederacy.
A fourth man, destined to be more
famous than any of the others, was Abraham Lincoln.
The first three of these were officers in the
army of the United States. Lincoln was at first a
private soldier, but was afterwards elected captain
of his company, with whom he had come to the
rescue of the white settlers from the lower part
of the State.</p>
<p>The war did not last long, and there was not
much glory gained by anybody in it. Black Hawk
was beaten, and that country had peace ever after.
For many years, and even unto this day, I make no
doubt, the early settlers of the Rock River country
loved to tell stories of the Black Hawk war, of
their own sufferings, exploits, hardships, and adventures.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
Father Dixon, as he was called, did
not choose to talk much about himself, for he
was a modest old gentleman, and was not given,
as they used to say, to &#8220;blowing his own horn,&#8221;
but his memory was a treasure-house of delightful
anecdotes and reminiscences of those old times;
and young and old would sit around the comfortable
stove of a country store, during a dull winter
evening, drinking in tales of Indian warfare and
of the &#8220;old settlers&#8221; that had been handed down
from generation to generation.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how boys brought up in an
atmosphere like this, rich in traditions of the long-past
in which the early settlement of the country
figured, should become imbued with the same spirit
of adventure that had brought their fathers from
the older States to this new region of the West.
Boys played at Indian warfare over the very
ground on which they had learned to believe the
Sacs and Foxes had skirmished years and years
before. They loved to hear of Black Hawk and
his brother, the Prophet, as he was called; and I
cannot tell you with what reverence they regarded
Father Dixon, the white-haired old man who had
actually talked and traded with the famous Indians,
and whose name had been given him as a title of
respect by the great Black Hawk himself.</p>
<p>Among the boys who drank in this sort of lore
were Charlie and Alexander Howell and their
cousin Oscar Bryant. Charlie, when he had arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
at his eighteenth birthday, esteemed himself
a man, ready to put away childish things; and yet,
in his heart, he dearly loved the traditions of the
Indian occupation of the country, and wished that
he had been born earlier, so that he might have
had a share in the settlement of the Rock River
region, its reclamation from the wilderness, and
the chase of the wild Indian. As for Alexander,
commonly known as &#8220;Sandy,&#8221; he had worn out
a thick volume of Cooper&#8217;s novels before he was
fifteen years old, at which interesting point in his
career I propose to introduce him to you. Oscar
was almost exactly as many years and days old as
his cousin. But two boys more unlike in appearance
could not be found anywhere in a long summer
day. Sandy was short, stubbed, and stocky
in build. His face was florid and freckled, and
his hair and complexion, like his name, were
sandy. Oscar was tall, slim, wiry, with a long,
oval face, black hair, and so lithe in his motions
that he was invariably cast for the part of the
leading Indian in all games that required an aboriginal
character.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell carried on a transportation business,
until the railroads came into the country and his
occupation was gone. Then he began to consider
seriously the notion of going further west with
his boys to get for them the same chances of early
forestalling the settlement of the country that he
had had in Illinois. In the West, at least in those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
days, nearly everybody was continually looking
for a yet further West to which they might emigrate.
Charlie Howell was now a big and willing,
good-natured boy; he ought to be striking out for
himself and getting ready to earn his own living.
At least, so his father thought.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant was engaged in a profitable business,
and he had no idea of going out into another
West for himself or his boy. Oscar was likely to
be a scholar, a lawyer, or a minister, perhaps.
Even at the age of fifteen, he had written &#8220;a
piece&#8221; which the editor of the Dixon <i>Telegraph</i>
had thought worthy of the immortality of print
in his columns.</p>
<p>But about this time, the Northern States were
deeply stirred by the struggle in the new Territory
of Kansas to decide whether freedom or slavery
should be established therein. This was in
1854 and thereabout. The Territory had been
left open and unoccupied for a long time. Now
settlers were pouring into it from adjacent States,
and the question whether freedom should be the
rule, or whether slave-holding was to be tolerated,
became a very important one. Missouri and Arkansas,
being the States nearest to Kansas, and
holding slavery to be a necessity, furnished the
largest number of emigrants who went to vote in
favor of bringing slavery into the new Territory;
but others of the same way of thinking came from
more distant States, even as far off as South Carolina,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
all bent on voting for slavery in the laws that
were to be made. For the most part, these people
from the slave States did not go prepared to make
their homes in Kansas or Nebraska; for some went
to the adjoining Territory of Nebraska, which was
also ready to have slavery voted up or down.
The newcomers intended to stay just long enough
to vote and then return to their own homes.</p>
<p>The people of the free States of the North heard
of all this with much indignation. They had
always supposed that the new Territories were to
be free from slavery. They saw that if slavery
should be allowed there, by and by, when the two
Territories would become States, they would be
slave States, and then there would be more slave
States than free States in the Union. So they
held meetings, made speeches, and passed resolutions,
denouncing this sort of immigration as wrong
and wicked. Then immigrants from Iowa, Illinois,
and other Northern States, even as far off
as Massachusetts, sold their homes and household
goods and started for the Promised Land, as many
of them thought it to be. For the men in Kansas
who were opposed to slavery wrote and sent far
and wide papers and pamphlets, setting forth in
glowing colors the advantages of the new and
beautiful country beyond the Missouri River, open
to the industry and enterprise of everybody. Soon
the roads and highways of Iowa were dotted with
white-topped wagons of immigrants journeying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Kansas, and long lines of caravans, with families
and with small knots of men, stretched their way
across the country nearest to the Territory.</p>
<p>Some of these passed through Dixon, and the
boys gazed with wonder at the queer inscriptions
that were painted on the canvas covers of the
wagons; they longed to go with the immigrants,
and taste the sweets of a land which was represented
to be full of wild flowers, game in great
abundance, and fine streams, and well-wooded hills
not far away from the water. They had heard
their elders talk of the beauties of Kansas, and of
the great outrage that was to be committed on that
fair land by carrying slavery into it; and although
they did not know much about the politics of the
case, they had a vague notion that they would like
to have a hand in the exciting business that was
going on in Kansas.</p>
<p>Both parties to this contest thought they were
right. Men who had been brought up in the slave
States believed that slavery was a good thing&ndash;&ndash;good
for the country, good for the slave-owner,
and even good for the slave. They could not
understand how anybody should think differently
from them. But, on the other hand, those who
had never owned slaves, and who had been born
and brought up in the free States, could not be
brought to look upon slavery as anything but a
very wicked thing. For their part, they were willing
(at least, some of them were) to fight rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
than consent that the right of one man to own
another man should be recognized in the Territories
of Kansas and Nebraska. Some of these started
at once for the debatable land; others helped their
neighbors to go, and many others stayed at home
and talked about it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bryant, Oscar&#8217;s mother, said: &#8220;Dear me,
I am tired and sick of hearing about &#8216;bleeding
Kansas.&#8217; I do wish, husband, you would find
something else to talk about before Oscar. You
have got him so worked up that I shouldn&#8217;t be the
least bit surprised if he were to start off with some
of those tired-looking immigrants that go traipsing
through the town day by day.&#8221; Mrs. Bryant was
growing anxious, now that her husband was so
much excited about the Kansas-Nebraska struggle,
as it was called, he could think of nothing else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE FIRE SPREADS.</h3>
</div>
<p>One fine morning in May, Mr. Bryant was standing
at his front gate watching for his brother-in-law,
Mr. Howell, to come down the street.</p>
<p>He held a newspaper in his hand, and with this,
loosely rolled, he was impatiently tapping on the
gate as Mr. Howell drew near. Evidently something
had happened to disturb him.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Aleck,&#8221; he exclaimed, as soon as his
brother-in-law was within the sound of his voice,
&#8220;I can stand this sort of thing no longer. I&#8217;m
bound to go to Kansas. I&#8217;ve been thinking it
over, and I have about made up my mind to go.
Brubaker will take my store and the good-will of
the concern. Oscar is wild to go, and his mother
is perfectly able to take care of the house while I
am getting ready for her to come out. What
d&#8217;ye say? Will you go too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Howell, slowly, &#8220;you nearly
take my breath away! What&#8217;s happened to stir
you up so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just listen to this!&#8221; cried the other, &#8220;just
listen!&#8221; and, unfolding his newspaper, he read,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
with glowing cheeks and kindling eyes, an account
of an attack made by some of the &#8220;pro-slavery
men,&#8221; as they were named, on a party of free-State
immigrants who had attempted to cross the
river near Kansas City. His voice trembled with
excitement, and when he had finished reading, he
asked his companion what he thought of that.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell looked pensively down the street,
now embowered with the foliage of early summer,
noted the peaceful aspect of the village, and the
tranquil picture which gardens, cottages, and sauntering
groups of school-children presented, and
then said slowly, &#8220;I never was much of a hand
at shooting, Charles, leastways, shooting at folks;
and I don&#8217;t know that I could take steady aim at
a man, even if I knew he was a Border Ruffian
out gunning for me. But I&#8217;m with you, Charles.
Charlie and Sandy can do a heap sight better in
Kansas, after things get settled, than they can
here. This place is too old; there&#8217;s too much
competition, and the boys will not have any show
if they stay here. But what does Amanda say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Amanda was Mr. Bryant&#8217;s wife, Mr. Aleck
Howell&#8217;s sister. When Aleck asked this question,
the two men looked at each other for a moment,
queerly and without speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;ll hate to part with Oscar; he&#8217;s the
apple of her eye, as it were. But I guess she will
listen to reason. When I read this piece in the
paper to her this morning, at the breakfast-table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
she was as mad as a wet hen. As for Oscar, he&#8217;s
so fired up about it that he is down in the wood-shed
chopping wood to blow off steam. Hear him?&#8221;
And Mr. Bryant laughed quietly, notwithstanding
his rising anger over the news of the day.</p>
<p>At that moment Sandy came whooping around
the corner, intent on overtaking a big yellow dog,
his constant companion,&ndash;&ndash;Bose by name,&ndash;&ndash;who
bounded along far in advance of the boy. &#8220;See
here, Sandy,&#8221; said his uncle, &#8220;how would you like
to go to Kansas with your father, Oscar, Charlie,
and myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Kansas? shooting buffaloes, deer, Indians,
and all that? To Kansas? Oh, come, now, Uncle
Charles, you don&#8217;t mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do mean it, my laddie,&#8221; said the elder
man, affectionately patting the freckled cheek of
the lad. &#8220;I do mean it, and if you can persuade
your father to go along and take you and Charlie
with him, we&#8217;ll make up a party&ndash;&ndash;just we five&ndash;&ndash;that
will scare the Border Ruffians &#8217;way into the
middle of next year.&#8221; Then, with a more serious
air, he added, &#8220;This is a fight for freedom, my
boy, and every man and every boy who believes in
God and Liberty can find a chance to help. I&#8217;m
sure <i>we</i> can.&#8221; This he said with a certain sparkle
of his eye that may have meant mischief to any
Border Ruffian that might have been there to see
and hear.</p>
<p>As for Sandy, he turned two or three hand-springs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
by way of relieving his feelings; then,
having once more assured himself that the two
men had serious thoughts of migrating to Kansas,
he rushed off to the wood-shed to carry the wonderful
news to Oscar. Dropping his axe, the lad
listened with widened eyes to the story that Sandy
had to tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Sandy,&#8221; he said, with an air of
great wisdom, &#8220;I thought there was something in
the wind. Oh, I never saw father so roused as he
was when he read that story in the Chicago <i>Press
and Tribune</i> this morning. Why, I thought he&#8217;d
just get up and howl when he had read it out to
mother. Jimmini! Do you really suppose that
he will go? And take us? And Uncle Aleck?
Oh, wouldn&#8217;t that be too everlastingly bully for
anything?&#8221; Oscar, as you will see, was given to
the use of slang, especially when under great excitement.
The two boys rushed back to the gate,
where the brothers-in-law were still talking eagerly
and in undertones.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your mother and Aunt Amanda will consent,
I guess we will go,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant, with a smile
on his face as he regarded the flushed cheeks and
eager eyes of Sandy and Oscar. Sandy&#8217;s father
added: &#8220;And I&#8217;ll answer for your mother, my
son. She and I have talked this thing over many
a time, more on your account and Charlie&#8217;s than
for the sake of &#8216;bleeding Kansas,&#8217; however. I&#8217;m
bound to say that. Every man is in honor bound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to do his duty by the country and by the good
cause; but I have got to look after my boys first.&#8221;
And the father lovingly laid his hand on Sandy&#8217;s
sturdy shoulder. &#8220;Do you think you could fight,
if the worst comes to the worst, Sandy, boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the lad protested confidently that he
could fight; certainly he could protect his rights
and his father&#8217;s rights, even with a gun, if that
should be found necessary. But he admitted that,
on the whole, he would rather shoot buffaloes and
antelope, both of which species of large game he
had already learned were tolerably plentiful in
Kansas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of it, Oscar, we might have some
real Indian-fighting out there, like that Father
Dixon and the rest of the old settlers had in the
time of the Black Hawk war.&#8221;</p>
<p>His father assured him, however, that there was
no longer any danger from the red man in Kansas.
The wild Indians were now far out on the frontier,
beyond the region to which emigrants would probably
go in search of homestead lands for settlement.
Sandy looked relieved at this explanation.
He was not anxious for fighting with anybody.
Fun was more to his liking.</p>
<p>The two mothers, when they were informed of
the decision of the male members of the family,
made very little opposition to the emigration
scheme. In fact, Mrs. Howell had really felt for
some time past that her boys would be better provided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
for in a new country. She had been one of
the &#8220;old settlers&#8221; of Dixon, having been brought
out from the interior of New York when she and
her brother were small children. She had the
same spirit of adventure that he had, and, although
she remembered very well the privations and the
discomforts of those early days, it was more with
amusement than sorrow that she recalled them to
mind, now that they were among the traditions of
long-past years. The two young Howells were
never weary of hearing their mother tell of the
time when she killed a wildcat with her father&#8217;s
rifle, or of her walking fifteen miles and back to
buy herself a bonnet-ribbon to wear to her first
ball in the court-house. Now her silent influence
made it easier for the Kansas Exodus (as they
already called their scheme) to be accepted all
around.</p>
<p>The determination of the two families to migrate
made some stir in the town. It was yet a small
place, and everybody knew every other body&#8217;s
business. The Bryants and Howells were among
the &#8220;old families,&#8221; and their momentous step
created a little ripple of excitement among their
friends and acquaintances. The boys enjoyed the
talk and the gossip that arose around them, and
already considered themselves heroes in a small
way. With envious eyes and eager faces, their
comrades surrounded them, wherever they went,
asking questions about their outfit, their plans,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and their future movements. Every boy in Dixon
looked on the three prospective boy settlers as the
most fortunate of all their young playfellows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish my father would catch the &#8216;Kansas
fever,&#8217;&#8221; said Hiram Fender, excitedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you suppose your father could give it to him,
Charlie? Do you suppose your uncle would take
me along if Dad would let me go? Oh, wouldn&#8217;t
that be just gaudy, if I could go! Then there
would be four of us boys. Try it on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the two families resolutely attended to their
own business, asking help from nobody, and not
even so much as hinting to anybody that it would
be a good thing for others to go with them to the
Promised Land. The three boys were speedily in
the midst of preparations for their migration. It
was now well along in the middle of May. If they
were to take up land claims in Kansas and get in
a crop, they had no time to spare. The delightful
excitement of packing, of buying arms and ammunition,
and of winding up all the small concerns
of their life in Dixon made the days pass swiftly
by. There were all the details of tents for camping-out,
provisions for the march, and rough clothing
and walking gear for the new life beyond to
be looked after.</p>
<p>Some of the notions of the boys, in regard to
what was needed and what was to be expected
from the land beyond, were rather crude. And
perhaps their fathers were not in all cases so wise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
as they thought themselves. The boys, however,
cherished the idea that absolutely everything they
should require in Kansas must be carried from
Illinois. &#8220;Why,&#8221; said the practical Mr. Howell,
&#8220;if we cannot buy ploughs, cattle, and seed, cheaper
in Missouri than we can here, we can at least save
the labor and cost of transportation. We don&#8217;t
want to haul a year&#8217;s provisions, either. We expect
to raise something to eat, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie, to whom this remonstrance was addressed,
replied, &#8220;Well, of course we can raise
some garden truck, and I suppose we can buy
bacon and flour cheaper in Missouri than here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the game,&#8221; interrupted Oscar and
Sandy, both in one breath. &#8220;Governor Robinson&#8217;s
book says that the country is swarming with
game,&#8221; added Sandy, excitedly.</p>
<p>The boys had devoured a little book by Mr.
Robinson, the free-State Governor of Kansas, in
which the richness of the Promised Land was
glowingly set forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much time we shall have to shoot buffaloes
and antelope when we are breaking up the sod and
planting corn,&#8221; Mr. Howell answered with a shade
of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we may have to fire at bigger game than
either of those,&#8221; added Mr. Bryant, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Border Ruffians?&#8221; asked Sandy, with a feeble
attempt at a grin. His mother shuddered and
hastily went out of the room. The Kansas scheme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
seemed no longer pleasant to her, when she read
the dreadful stories of violence and bloodshed with
which some of the Western newspapers were teeming.
But it was settled that most of the tools
needed for farming could be bought better in
Missouri than in Illinois; the long haul would be
saved, and the horses with which they were to
start could be exchanged for oxen to good advantage
when they reached &#8220;the river.&#8221; They had
already adopted the common phrase, &#8220;the river,&#8221;
for the Missouri River, then generally used by
people emigrating westward.</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps the Missourians will not sell you
anything when they know that you are free-State
men,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Bryant, timidly, for this was
a family council.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; answered Mr. Howell, sturdily, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
risk that. I never saw a man yet with anything
to sell who wouldn&#8217;t sell it when the money was
shaken in his face. The newspapers paint those
border men pretty black, I know; but if they stop
to ask a man&#8217;s politics before they make a bargain
with him, they must be queer cattle. They are
more than human or less than human, not Americans
at all, if they do business in that way.&#8221; In
the end they found that Mr. Howell was entirely
right.</p>
<p>All was settled at last, and that, too, in some
haste, for the season was rapidly advancing when
planting must be attended to, if they were to plant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
that year for the fall harvest. From the West
they heard reports of hosts of people pouring into
the new Territory, of land being in great demand,
and of the best claims near the Missouri being
taken by early emigrants. They must be in a
hurry if they were to get a fair chance with the
rest and a fair start on their farm,&ndash;&ndash;a farm yet
existing only in their imagination.</p>
<p>Their wagon, well stored with clothing and provisions,
a few books, Oscar&#8217;s violin, a medicine
chest, powder, shot, and rifle-balls, and an assortment
of odds and ends,&ndash;&ndash;the wagon, so long a
magical repository of hopes and the most delightful
anticipations, was ready at last. It stood at the
side gate of Mr. Bryant&#8217;s home, with a &#8220;spike
team&#8221; (two horses at the pole, and one horse for
a leader) harnessed. It was a serious, almost solemn,
moment. Now that the final parting had
come, the wrench with which the two families
were to be broken up seemed harder than any of
the members had expected. The two mothers,
bravely keeping up smiling faces, went about the
final touches of preparations for the lads&#8217; departure
and the long journey of their husbands.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell mounted the wagon with Sandy by
his side; Mr. Bryant took his seat with the other
two boys in an open buggy, which they were to
drive to &#8220;the river&#8221; and there trade for a part
of their outfit. Fond and tearful kisses had been
exchanged and farewells spoken. They drove off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
into the West. The two women stood at the gate,
gazing after them with tear-dimmed eyes as long
as they were in sight; and when the little train
disappeared behind the first swale of the prairie,
they burst into tears and went into the house
which was now left unto them desolate.</p>
<p>It was a quiet party that drove over the prairie
that bright and beautiful morning. The two boys
in the buggy spoke occasionally in far-off-sounding
voices about indifferent things that attracted their
attention as they drove along. Mr. Howell held
the reins, with a certain stern sense of duty on
his dark and handsome face. Sandy sat silently by
his side, the big tears coursing down his freckled
cheeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>ON THE DISPUTED TERRITORY.</h3>
</div>
<p>The straggling, unkempt, and forlorn town of
Parkville, Missouri, was crowded with strangers
when the emigrants arrived there after a long and
toilsome drive through Iowa. They had crossed
the Mississippi from Illinois into Iowa, at Fulton,
on the eastern shore, and after stopping to rest for
a day or two in Clinton, a pretty village on the
opposite bank, had pushed on, their faces ever
set westward. Then, turning in a southwesterly
direction, they travelled across the lower part of
the State, and almost before they knew it they
were on the sacred soil of Missouri, the dangers of
entering which had been pictured to them all along
the route. They had been warned by the friendly
settlers in Iowa to avoid St. Joseph, one of the
crossings from Missouri into Kansas; it was a nest
of Border Ruffians, so they were told, and they
would surely have trouble. They must also steer
clear of Leavenworth; for that town was the headquarters
of a number of Missourians whose names
were already terrible all over the Northern States,
from Kansas to Massachusetts Bay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But there is the military at Fort Leavenworth,&#8221;
replied Mr. Bryant. &#8220;Surely they will
protect the citizens of the United States who are
peaceful and well-behaved. We are only peaceable
immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; answered an Iowa man. &#8220;All the
army officers in this part of the country are pro-slavery
men. They are in sympathy with the pro-slavery
men, anyhow, and if they had been sent
here to keep free-State men out of the Territory,
they couldn&#8217;t do any different from what they are
doing. It&#8217;s an infernal shame, that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bryant said nothing in reply, but as they trudged
along, for the roads were very bad, and they could
not often ride in their vehicles now, his face grew
dark and red by turns. Finally he broke out,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Aleck,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
sneak into the Territory. If these people think
they can scare law-abiding and peaceable citizens
of a free country from going upon the land of
these United States, we might just as well fight
first as last. For one, I will not be driven out of
a country that I have got just as much right to as
any of these hot-headed Missouri fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>His brother-in-law looked troubled, but before
he could speak the impetuous and fiery Sandy
said: &#8220;That&#8217;s the talk, Uncle Charlie! Let&#8217;s go
in by the shortest way, and tackle the Border
Ruffians if they tackle us. Who&#8217;s afraid?&#8221; And
the lad bravely handled his &#8220;pepper-box,&#8221; as his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
old-fashioned five-barrelled revolver was sportively
called by the men of those days; for the modern
revolver with one barrel for all the chambers of
the weapon had not then come into use. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
afraid?&#8221; he repeated fiercely, looking around.
Everybody burst out laughing, and the valorous
Sandy looked rather crestfallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid, for one,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;I want
no fighting, no bloodshed. I want to get into the
Territory and get to work on our claim, just as
soon as possible; but if we can&#8217;t get there without
a fight, why then, I&#8217;ll fight. But I ain&#8217;t seeking
for no fight.&#8221; When Aleck Howell was excited,
his grammar went to the four winds. His view
of the situation commended itself to the approval
of Oscar, who said he had promised his mother
that he would avoid every appearance of hostile
intention, keep a civil tongue in his head, have his
weapons out of sight and his powder always dry.</p>
<p>The emigrants decided to go into Kansas by
way of Parkville.</p>
<p>At Claybank, half-way between the Iowa line
and the Missouri River, they encountered a drover
with a herd of cattle. He was eager to dicker
with the Kansas emigrants, and offered them what
they considered to be a very good bargain in exchanging
oxen for their horses. They were now
near the Territory, and the rising prices of almost
everything that immigrants required warned them
that they were not far from the point where an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
outfit could no longer be bought at any reasonable
price. The boys were loth to part with their
buggy; for, although they had been often compelled
to go afoot through some of the worst roads
in the States of Iowa and Missouri, they had clung
to the notion that they might have a pair of horses
to take into the Territory, and, while the buggy
was left to them, they had a refuge in times of
weariness with walking; and these were rather
frequent. The wagon was exchanged for another,
suitable for oxen.</p>
<p>The immigrants drove gayly into Parkville. They
were in sight of the Promised Land. The Big
Muddy, as Missourians affectionately call the turbid
stream that gives name to their State, rolled
sluggishly between the Parkville shore and the
low banks fringed with cottonwoods that were the
eastern boundary of Kansas. Looking across, they
could see long lines of white-covered wagons, level
plains dotted with tents, and the rising smoke of
many fires, where people who had gone in ahead
of them were cooking their suppers; for they
entered Parkville late in the afternoon. It was a
commonplace-looking view of Kansas, after all, and
not at all like what the lads had fancied it would
be. Sandy very emphatically expressed his disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you have, Sandy?&#8221; asked his
uncle, with some amusement. &#8220;Did you expect
to see wild honey dripping out of the cottonwoods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and sycamores, buffaloes and deer standing up and
waiting to be shot at, and a farm ready to be
tilled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied the boy, a little shamefacedly,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t exactly expect to see all those things;
but somehow the country looks awful flat and
dull. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer, Mr. Bryant pointed out a line of
blue slopes in the distance. &#8220;Those are not very
high hills, my boy, to be sure, but they are on the
rolling prairie beyond, and as soon as we get away
from the river we shall find a bluffy and diversified
country, I&#8217;ll warrant you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; don&#8217;t you remember,&#8221; broke in Oscar,
eagerly, &#8220;Governor Robinson&#8217;s book told all about
the rolling and undulating country of the Territory,
and the streams that run under high bluffs
in some places?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy admitted that this was true of the book;
but he added, &#8220;Some books do lie, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Governor Robinson&#8217;s book,&#8221; commented
his brother Charlie, with a slight show of resentment.
For Charlie had made a study of the reports
from the Promised Land.</p>
<p>But a more pressing matter was the attitude
of the border-State men toward the free-State emigrants,
and the question of making the necessary
purchases for their farming scheme. Parkville
was all alive with people, and there were many
border-State men among them. Some of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
regarded the newcomers with unmistakable hostility,
noting which, Sandy and Oscar took good
care to keep near their two grown-up protectors;
and the two men always went about with their
weapons within easy reaching distance. All of the
Borderers were opposed to any more free-State
men going into the Territory; and many of them
were disposed to stop this by force, if necessary.
At one time, the situation looked very serious, and
Sandy got his &#8220;pepper-box&#8221; into position. But
the trouble passed away, and the arrival of fifteen
or twenty teams, accompanied by a full complement
of men, checked a rising storm of wrath.</p>
<p>From Platte City, a short distance up the river,
however, came doleful and distressing stories of
the ill-treatment of the free-State men who had
gone that way. They were harassed and hindered,
and, in some cases, their teams were deliberately
turned about and driven back on the road by
which they had come. It was useless to remonstrate
when the rifles of a dozen men were levelled
at the would-be immigrants. But our travellers in
Parkville heard a good story of the bravery of one
free-State man who had been refused transportation
across the ferry at Platte City, kept by an ardent
pro-slavery man. The intending immigrant, unconscious
of any hindrance to his crossing, was
calmly driving down to the ferry-boat, a flat-bottomed
craft propelled by long oars, or sweeps,
when the ferryman stopped him with the question,
&#8220;What hev ye got into yer waggin?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oxen,&#8221; sententiously replied the newcomer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s them thar cattle follering on behind?&#8221;
he asked, pointing to a drove of milch-cattle
in the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Caouws,&#8221; answered the immigrant, in the broad
pronunciation peculiar to provincial people of the
New England States.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was the rejoinder; &#8220;a man that
says &#8216;caouws&#8217; can&#8217;t go over this yere ferry withouten
he&#8217;s got the tickets.&#8221; No argument would
induce the ferryman to explain what the tickets
were and where they could be procured. Finally,
his patience exhausted, the free-State man suddenly
drew from the big pockets of his frock a pair of
tremendous pistols, ready cocked, and, holding them
full in the face of the surprised ferryman, he said,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are my tickets, and I&#8217;m going across
this ferry right off, caouws or no caouws!&#8221; And
he went.</p>
<p>Even at Parkville, where there was very little
difficulty in crossing, as compared with what there
had been earlier in the struggle for Kansas, they
were advised by discreet friends and sympathizers
to be on the lookout for opposition. Every fresh
arrival of free-State men angered yet more the
Borderers who were gathered there to hinder and,
if possible, prevent further immigration. Mr. Bryant
chafed under the necessity of keeping his
voice hushed on the topic that engaged all his
thoughts; and Oscar and Sandy were ready to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
fight their way across the river; at least they
said so.</p>
<p>They did find, however, that the buying of provisions
and farming-tools required for their future
use, was out of the question in Parkville. Whether
it was the unexpected demand, or a refusal of
the Missourians to sell to free-State men, they
could not determine. But the prices of everything
they wanted were very high. What should
they do? These articles they must have. But
their cost here was far beyond their most extravagant
estimates. When Mr. Howell was reminded
by his brother-in-law how he had said that no
politics could interfere with trade and prices, he
was amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it does look as if these
Missourians would not sell at fair prices because
they want to hinder us; but don&#8217;t you see that
the demand is greater than the supply? I know
these folks are bitterly hostile to us; but the
reason why they have so small a stock of goods
on hand is that they have sold out to other free-State
men that have come before us to buy the
same things. Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant was obliged to admit that this was
a reasonable explanation; but as he had begun
by thinking that every Borderer hated a free-State
man and would do him an injury if he could, he
did not give up that notion willingly. He was
certain that there was a plot in the high prices of
bacon, flour, corn-meal, and ploughs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>In this serious dilemma, Charlie came to the
relief of the party with the information that a
free-State man, whose team had just recrossed the
river for a load of supplies sent him by a wagon
that was to return to Iowa, brought news that a
large trading-post had been opened at a new Kansas
town called Quindaro. He said that the Iowa
man told him that prices were just now lower in
Quindaro than they had ever been in Parkville.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quindaro?&#8221; said Oscar, musingly;&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;why,
that must be an Indian name,&ndash;&ndash;feminine Indian
name, too, unless I miss my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant had heard of Quindaro. It was a
brand-new town, a few miles down the river, settled
by free-State men and named for a young,
full-blooded Indian girl of the Delaware tribe.
The town was on the borders of the Delaware
reservation, which in those days came close to the
Missouri River. Charlie, also, had gathered some
facts about the town, and he added that Quindaro
was a good place to start from, going westward.
The party had laid in a stock of groceries&ndash;&ndash;coffee,
tea, and other articles of that description&ndash;&ndash;before
leaving home. Now they needed staple provisions,
a few farming tools, a breaking-plough, and
some seed corn. Few thought of planting anything
but corn; but the thrifty settlers from
Illinois knew the value of fresh vegetables, and
they were resolved to have &#8220;garden truck&#8221; just
as soon as seeds could be planted and brought to
maturity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And side-meat?&#8221; asked Sandy, wonderingly,
as he heard his father inquiring the price of that
article of food. Side-meat, in the South and
West, is the thin flank of a porker, salted and
smoked after the fashion of hams, and in those
parts of the Southwest it was (and probably is)
the staple article of food among the people. It
is sold in long, unattractive-looking slabs; and
when Sandy heard its name mentioned, his disgust
as well as his wonder was kindled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Side-meat?&#8221; he repeated, with a rising inflection.
&#8220;Why, I thought we were going to live on
game,&ndash;&ndash;birds and buffalo and the like! Side-meat?
Well, that makes me sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men laughed, and Mr. Howell said,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sandy, you are bent on hunting and not
on buckling down to farm work. How do you
suppose we are going to live if we have nothing
to eat but wild game that we kill, and breadstuffs
and vegetables that we buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy had thought that they might be able
to step out into the woods or prairie, between
times, as it were, and knock down a few head of
game when the day&#8217;s work was done, or had not
begun. When he said as much, the two heads of
the party laughed again, and even Charlie joined
in the glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear infant,&#8221; said his father, seriously, but
with a twinkle in his eye, &#8220;game is not so plenty
anywhere as that; and if it were, we should soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
tire of it. Now side-meat &#8216;sticks to the ribs,&#8217; as
the people hereabouts will tell you, and it is the
best thing to fall back upon when fresh meat fails.
We can&#8217;t get along without it, and that is a fact;
hey, Charlie?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the party saw the wisdom of this
suggestion, and Sandy was obliged to give up,
then and there, his glowing views of a land so
teeming with game that one had only to go out
with a rifle, or even a club, and knock it over. But
he mischievously insisted that if side-meat did
&#8220;stick to the ribs,&#8221; as the Missourians declared,
they did not eat much of it, for, as a rule, the
people whom they met were a very lank and slab-sided
lot. &#8220;Clay-eaters,&#8221; their new acquaintance
from Quindaro said they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay-eaters?&#8221; asked Charlie, with a puzzled
look. &#8220;They are clayey-looking in the face. But
it can&#8217;t be possible that they actually eat clay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they do, and I have seen them chewing
it. There is a fine, soft clay found in these parts,
and more especially south of here; it has a greasy
feeling, as if it was a fatty substance, and the
natives eat it just as they would candy. Why, I
should think that it would form a sand-bar inside
of a man, after awhile; but they take to it just as
naturally!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have got to choose between side-meat and
clay for a regular diet,&#8221; said Sandy, &#8220;give me
side-meat every time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>That night, having made their plans to avoid
the prying eyes of the border-State men, who in
great numbers were now coming in, well-armed
and looking somewhat grimly at the free-State
men, the little party crossed the river. Ten dollars,
good United States money, was demanded by
the ferryman as the price of their passage; it
looked like robbery, but there was no other way
of getting over the river and into the Promised
Land; so it was paid, with many a wrench of the
patience of the indignant immigrants; and they
pitched their tent that night under the stars and
slept soundly on the soil of &#8220;bleeding Kansas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bright and early next morning, the boys were
up and stirring, for now was to begin their camp
life. Hitherto, they had slept in their tent, but
had taken their meals at the farm-houses and small
taverns of the country through which they had
passed. They would find few such conveniences
in the new country into which they had come, and
they had been warned that in Kansas the rule was
&#8220;every man for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They made sad work with their first breakfast
in camp. Oscar had taken a few lessons in cooking
from his mother, before leaving home, and the
two men had had some experience in that line of
duty when out on hunting expeditious in Illinois,
years before. So they managed to make coffee,
fry slices of side-meat, and bake a hoe-cake of
Indian-corn meal. &#8220;Hog and hominy,&#8221; said Sandy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
father. &#8220;That&#8217;s the diet of the country, and that
is what we shall come to, and we might as well
take it first as last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s worse provender than this, where
there&#8217;s none,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant, cheerfully; &#8220;and
before we get through we shall be hungry more
than once for hog and hominy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an enlivening sight that greeted the eyes
of the newcomers as they looked around upon the
flat prairie that stretched along the river-side.
The tents of the immigrants glistened in the rising
sun. The smoke of many camp-fires arose on the
summer air. Groups of men were busily making
preparations for their long tramp westward, and,
here and there, women and children were gathered
around the white-topped wagons, taking their early
breakfast or getting ready for the day&#8217;s march.
Here, too, could now be seen the rough and surly-looking
border men who were on the way to points
along the route that were to be occupied by them
before too many free-State men should come in.
An election of some sort, the newcomers could
not exactly make out what, was to take place in a
day or two, and the Missourians whom they had
seen flocking into Parkville were ready to vote as
soon as they got into the Territory.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, the boys sauntered around
through the camps, viewing the novel sights with
vast amusement. It was like a militia muster at
home, except that the only soldier element they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
saw was the band of rough-looking and rough-talking
men who were bound to vote and fight for
slavery. They swaggered about with big pistols
girt at their hips and rifles over their shoulders,
full-bearded and swarthy, each one a captain apparently,
all without much organization, but very
serious in their intention to vote and to fight. It
really seemed as if they had reached the fighting-ground
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, daddy,&#8221; said Oscar, as he came in
from the camps when the Dixon caravan was ready
to move; &#8220;see what I found in this newspaper. It
is a piece of poetry, and a mighty fine piece, too&#8221;;
and the boy began to read some lines beginning
thus,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;We cross the prairie as of old<br />

<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>The homestead of the free!&#8221;</span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well; I can&#8217;t bother about poetry, now,&#8221;
said the father, hastily. &#8220;I have some prose work
on hand, just about this time. I&#8217;m trying to drive
these pesky cattle, and I don&#8217;t make a very good
fist at it. Your Uncle Aleck has gone on ahead,
and left me to manage the team; but it&#8217;s new business
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John G. Whittier is the name at the top of
these verses. I&#8217;ve heard of him. He&#8217;s a regular-built
poet,&ndash;&ndash;lives somewhere down East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that, sonny; get on the other side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
of those steers, and see if you can&#8217;t gee them
around. Dear, dear, they&#8217;re dreadful obstinate
creatures!&#8221;</p>
<p>That night, however, when they were comfortably
and safely camped in Quindaro, amid the
live-oaks and the tall sycamores that embowered
the pretty little town, Oscar again brought the
newspaper to his father, and, with kindling eyes,
said,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it out, daddy; read the piece. Why, it
was written just for us, I do declare. It is called
&#8216;The Kansas Emigrants.&#8217; We are Kansas Emigrants,
aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>The father smiled kindly as he looked at the
flushed face and bright eyes of his boy, and took
from him the paper folded to show the verses. As
he read, his eyes, too, flashed and his lip trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Listen to this! It
is like a trumpet call!&#8221; And with a voice quivering
with emotion, he began the poem,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Something has got into my eyes,&#8221; said Mr.
Howell, as the last stanza was read. &#8220;Great
Scott! though, how that does stir a man&#8217;s blood!&#8221;
And he furtively wiped the moisture from his eyes.
It was time to put out the light and go to sleep,
for the night now was well advanced. But Mr.
Bryant, thoroughly aroused, read and re-read the
lines aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing &#8217;em,&#8221; said his brother-in-law, jokingly.
Bryant was a good singer, and he at once tuned
up with a fine baritone voice, recalling a familiar
tune that fitted the measure of the poem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Uncle Charlie,&#8221; cried Sandy,
from his blankets in the corner of the tent, &#8220;that&#8217;s
&#8216;Old Dundee.&#8217; Can&#8217;t you give us something
lively? Something not quite so solemn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so solemn, my laddie? Don&#8217;t you know
that this is a solemn age we are in, and a very solemn
business we are on? You&#8217;ll think so before
we get out of this Territory, or I am greatly mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s solemn, when he has to trot
over a piece of newly broken prairie, carrying a
pouchful of seed corn, dropping five grains in each
sod,&#8221; said his father, laughing, as he blew out the
candle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good song; a bully good song,&#8221; murmured
the boy, turning over to sleep. &#8220;But it
ought to be sung to something with more of a rig-a-jig-jig
to it.&#8221; So saying, he was off to the land
of dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE DELAWARES.</h3>
</div>
<p>Quindaro was a straggling but pretty little
town built among the groves of the west bank of
the Missouri. Here the emigrants found a store
or trading-post, well supplied with the goods they
needed, staple articles of food and the heavier
farming-tools being the first required. The boys
looked curiously at the big breaking-plough that
was to be of so much consequence to them in their
new life and labors. The prairies around their
Illinois home had been long broken up when they
were old enough to take notice of such things; and
as they were town boys, they had never had their
attention called to the implements of a prairie farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like a plough that has been sat down on
and flattened out,&#8221; was Oscar&#8217;s remark, after they
had looked the thing over very critically. It had
a long and massive beam, or body, and big, strong
handles, suggestive of hard work to be done with
it. &#8220;The nose,&#8221; as Sandy called the point of the
share, was long, flat, and as sharp as a knife. It
was this thin and knife-like point that was to cut
into the virgin turf of the prairie, and, as the sod
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
was cut, the share was to turn it over, bottom side
up, while the great, heavy implement was drawn
along by the oxen.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the sod is so thick and tough,&#8221; said Oscar,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how the oxen can drag the thing
through. Will our three yoke of cattle do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other and smiled.
This had been a subject of much anxious thought
with them. They had been told that they would
have difficulty in breaking up the prairie with
three yoke of oxen; they should have four yoke,
certainly. So when Mr. Howell explained that
they must get another yoke and then rely on their
being able to &#8220;change work&#8221; with some of their
neighbors who might have cattle, the boys laughed
outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighbors!&#8221; cried Sandy. &#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t
suppose we should have any neighbors within five
or ten miles. Did you, Oscar? I was in hopes we
wouldn&#8217;t have neighbors to plague us with their
pigs and chickens, and their running in to borrow
a cupful of molasses, or last week&#8217;s newspaper.
Neighbors!&#8221; and the boy&#8217;s brown face wore an
expression of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about neighbors, Sandy,&#8221; said
his uncle. &#8220;Even if we have any within five miles
of us, we shall do well. But if there is to be any
fighting, we shall want neighbors to join forces
with us, and we shall find them handy, anyhow, in
case of sickness or trouble. We cannot get along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
in a new country like this without neighbors, and
you bear that in mind, Master Sandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two leaders of this little flock had been
asking about the prospects for taking up claims
along the Kansas River, or the Kaw, as that stream
was then generally called. To their great dismay,
they had found that there was very little vacant
land to be had anywhere near the river. They
would have to push on still further westward if
they wished to find good land ready for the pre-emptor.
Rumors of fighting and violence came
from the new city of Lawrence, the chief settlement
of the free-State men, on the Kaw; and at
Grasshopper Falls, still further to the west, the
most desirable land was already taken up, and
there were wild stories of a raid on that locality
being planned by bands of Border Ruffians. They
were in a state of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;There she is! There she is!&#8221; said Charlie, in
a loud whisper, looking in the direction of a tall,
unpainted building that stood among the trees
that embowered the little settlement. Every one
looked and saw a young lady tripping along
through the hazel brush that still covered the
ground. She was rather stylishly dressed, &#8220;citified,&#8221;
Oscar said; she swung a beaded work-bag as
she walked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it? Who is it?&#8221; asked Oscar, breathlessly.
She was the first well-dressed young lady
he had seen since leaving Iowa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sh-h-h-h!&#8221; whispered Charlie. &#8220;That&#8217;s Quindaro.
A young fellow pointed her out to me last
night, just after we drove into the settlement. She
lives with her folks in that tall, thin house up
there. I have been looking for her to come out.
See, she&#8217;s just going into the post-office now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quindaro!&#8221; exclaimed Sandy. &#8220;Why, I thought
Quindaro was a squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a full-blooded Delaware Indian girl, that&#8217;s
what she is, and she was educated somewhere East
in the States; and this town is named for her.
She owns all the land around here, and is the belle
of the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got on hoop-skirts, too,&#8221; said Oscar.
&#8220;Just think of an Indian girl&ndash;&ndash;a squaw&ndash;&ndash;wearing
hoops, will you?&#8221; For all this happened,
my young reader must remember, when women&#8217;s
fashions were very different from what they now
are. Quindaro&ndash;&ndash;that is to say, the young Indian
lady of that time&ndash;&ndash;was dressed in the height of
fashion, but not in any way obtrusively. Charlie,
following with his eyes the young girl&#8217;s figure, as
she came out of the post-office and went across the
ravine that divided the settlement into two equal
parts, mirthfully said, &#8220;And only think! That is
a full-blooded Delaware Indian girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, their curiosity satisfied, the boys were evidently
disappointed with their first view of Indian
civilization. There were no blanketed Indians
loafing around in the sun and sleeping under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
shelter of the underbrush, as they had been taught
to expect to see them. Outside of the settlement,
men were ploughing and planting, breaking prairie,
and building cabins; and while our party were
looking about them, a party of Delawares drove
into town with several ox-carts to carry away the
purchases that one of their number had already
made. It was bewildering to boys who had been
brought up on stories of Black Hawk, the Prophet,
and the Sacs and Foxes of Illinois and Wisconsin.
A Delaware Indian, clad in the ordinary garb of a
Western farmer and driving a yoke of oxen, and
employing the same curious lingo used by the
white farmers, was not a picturesque object.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow that sixty dollars is a big price to pay
for a yoke of cattle,&#8221; said Mr. Howell, anxiously.
He was greatly concerned about the new purchase
that must be made here, according to the latest
information. &#8220;We might have got them for two-thirds
of that money back in Illinois. And you
know that Iowa chap only reckoned the price of
these at forty-five, when we traded with him at
Jonesville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use worrying about that now, Aleck,&#8221;
said his brother-in-law. &#8220;I know you thought
then that we should need four yoke for breaking
the prairie; but, then, you weren&#8217;t certain about
it, and none of the rest of us ever had any sod-ploughing
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, none of us,&#8221; said Sandy, with delightful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
gravity; at which everybody smiled. One would
have thought that Sandy was a veteran in everything
but farming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met a man this morning, while I was prowling
around the settlement,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;who
said that there was plenty of vacant land, of first-rate
quality, up around Manhattan. Where&#8217;s
that, father&ndash;&ndash;do you know? <i>He</i> didn&#8217;t, but some
other man, one of the New England Society fellows,
told him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>But nobody knew where Manhattan was. This
was the first time they had ever heard of the place.
The cattle question was first to be disposed of, however,
and as soon as the party had finished their
breakfast, the two men and Charlie sallied out
through the settlement to look up a bargain. Oscar
and Sandy were left in the camp to wash the dishes
and &#8220;clean up,&#8221; a duty which both of them despised
with a hearty hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I just fairly abominate, it&#8217;s
washing dishes,&#8221; said Sandy, seating himself on
the wagon-tongue and discontentedly eyeing a
huge tin pan filled with tin plates and cups, steaming
in the hot water that Oscar had poured over
them from the camp-kettle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s part of the play,&#8221; answered Oscar,
pleasantly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t boy&#8217;s work, let alone man&#8217;s
work, to be cooking and washing dishes. I wonder
what mother would think to see us at it?&#8221; And
a suspicious moisture gathered in the lad&#8217;s eyes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
as a vision of his mother&#8217;s tidy kitchen in far-off
Illinois rose before his mind. Sandy looked very
solemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as daddy says, it&#8217;s no use worrying about
things you can&#8217;t help,&#8221; continued the cheerful
Oscar; &#8220;so here goes, Sandy. You wash, and I&#8217;ll
dry &#8217;em.&#8221; And the two boys went on with their
disagreeable work so heartily that they soon had it
out of the way; Sandy remarking as they finished
it, that, for his part, he did not like the business
at all, but he did not think it fair that they two,
who could not do the heavy work, should grumble
over that they could do. &#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to look forward to months and
months of this sort of thing. Father and Uncle
Charlie say that we cannot have the rest of the
family come out until we have a house to put them
in&ndash;&ndash;a log-cabin, they mean, of course; and Uncle
Charlie says that we may not get them out until
another spring. I don&#8217;t believe he will be willing
for them to come out until he knows whether the
Territory is to be slave or free. Do you, Oscar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;Between you and
me, Sandy, I don&#8217;t want to go back to Illinois again,
for anything; but I guess father will make up his
mind about staying only when we find out if there
is to be a free-State government or not. Dear me,
why can&#8217;t the Missourians keep out of here and let
us alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a free country,&#8221; answered Sandy, sententiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s what Uncle Charlie is always
saying. The Missourians have just as good a right
here as we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they have no right to be bringing in
their slavery with &#8217;em,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;That
wouldn&#8217;t be a free country, would it, with one man
owning another man? Not much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s beyond me, Oscar. I suppose it&#8217;s a
free country only for the white man to come to.
But I haven&#8217;t any politics in me. Hullo! there
comes the rest of us driving a yoke of oxen.
Well, on my word, they have been quick about it.
Uncle Charlie is a master hand at hurrying things,
I will say,&#8221; added Sandy, admiringly. &#8220;He&#8217;s done
all the trading, I&#8217;ll be bound!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty-five dollars,&#8221; replied Bryant, to the boys&#8217;
eager inquiry as to the price paid for the yoke of
oxen. &#8220;Fifty-five dollars, and not so very dear,
after all, considering that there are more people
who want to buy than there are who want to sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now we are about ready to start; only a
few more provisions to lay in. Suppose we get
away by to-morrow morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s out of the question, Uncle Aleck,&#8221;
said Oscar. &#8220;What makes you in such a hurry?
Why, you have all along said we need not get
away from here for a week yet, if we did not want
to; the grass hasn&#8217;t fairly started yet, and we cannot
drive far without feed for the cattle. Four
yoke, too,&#8221; he added proudly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, Oscar,&#8221; said his father, lowering
his voice and looking around as if to see whether
anybody was within hearing distance, &#8220;we have
heard this morning that there was a raid on this
place threatened from Kansas City, over the border.
This is the free-State headquarters in this part of
the country, and it has got about that the store
here is owned and run by the New England Emigrant
Aid Society. So they are threatening to raid
the place, burn the settlement, run off the stock,
and loot the settlers. I should like to have a company
of resolute men to defend the place,&#8221; and
Mr. Bryant&#8217;s eyes flashed; &#8220;but this is not our
home, nor our fight, and I&#8217;m willing to &#8216;light out&#8217;
right off, or as soon as we get ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they come to-night, do you think?&#8221;
asked Sandy, and his big blue eyes looked very
big indeed. &#8220;Because we can&#8217;t get off until we
have loaded the wagon and fixed the wheels; you
said they must be greased before we travelled
another mile, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was agreed, however, that there was no immediate
danger of the raid&ndash;&ndash;certainly not that
night; but all felt that it was the part of prudence
to be ready to start at once; the sooner, the better.
When the boys went to their blankets that night,
they whispered to each other that the camp might
be raided and so they should be ready for any
assault that might come. Sandy put his &#8220;pepper-box&#8221;
under his pillow, and Charlie had his trusty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
rifle within reach. Oscar carried a double-barrelled
shot-gun of which he was very proud, and that
weapon, loaded with buckshot, was laid carefully
by the side of his blankets. The two elders of the
party &#8220;slept with one eye open,&#8221; as they phrased
it. But there was no alarm through the night,
except once when Mr. Howell got up and went
out to see how the cattle were getting on. He
found that one of the sentinels who had been set
by the Quindaro Company in consequence of the
scare, had dropped asleep on the wagon-tongue of
the Dixon party. Shaking him gently, he awoke
the sleeping sentinel, who at once bawled, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
shoot!&#8221; to the great consternation of the nearest
campers, who came flying out of their blankets
to see what was the matter. When explanations
had been made, all laughed, stretched themselves,
and then went to bed again to dream of Missouri
raiders.</p>
<p>The sun was well up in the sky next day, when
the emigrants, having completed their purchases,
yoked their oxen and drove up through the settlement
and ascended the rolling swale of land that
lay beyond the groves skirting the river. Here
were camps of other emigrants who had moved out
of Quindaro before them, or had come down from
the point on the Missouri opposite Parkville, in
order to get on to the road that led westward and
south of the Kaw. It was a beautifully wooded
country. When the lads admired the trees, Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Howell somewhat contemptuously said: &#8220;Not
much good, chiefly black-jacks and scrub-oaks&#8221;;
but the woods were pleasant to drive through, and
when they came upon scattered farms and plantations
with comfortable log-cabins set in the midst
of cultivated fields, the admiration of the party was
excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only look, Uncle Charlie,&#8221; cried Sandy,
&#8220;there&#8217;s a real flower-garden full of hollyhocks
and marigolds; and there&#8217;s a rose-bush climbing
over that log-cabin!&#8221; It was too early to distinguish
one flower from another by its blooms, but
Sandy&#8217;s sharp eyes had detected the leaves of the
old-fashioned flowers that he loved so well, which he
knew were only just planted in the farther northern
air of their home in Illinois. It was a pleasant-looking
Kansas home, and Sandy wondered how it
happened that this cosey living-place had grown
up so quickly in this new Territory. It looked as
if it were many years old, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still on the Delaware Indian reservation,&#8221;
replied his uncle. &#8220;The Government has
given the tribe a big tract of land here and away
up to the Kaw. They&#8217;ve been here for years, and
they are good farmers, I should say, judging from
the looks of things hereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then, as if to explain matters, a decent-looking
man, dressed in the rude fashion of the
frontier, but in civilized clothes, came out of the
cabin, and, pipe in mouth, stared not unkindly at
the passing wagon and its party.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy,&#8221; he civilly replied to a friendly greeting
from Mr. Howell. The boys knew that &#8220;How&#8221;
was a customary salutation among Indians, but
&#8220;Howdy&#8221; struck them as being comic; Sandy
laughed as he turned away his face. Mr. Bryant
lingered while the slow-moving oxen plodded their
way along the road, and the boys, too, halted to
hear what the dark-skinned man had to say. But
the Indian&ndash;&ndash;for he was a &#8220;civilized&#8221; Delaware&ndash;&ndash;was
a man of very few words. In answer to Mr.
Bryant&#8217;s questions, he said he was one of the chiefs
of the tribe; he had been to Washington to settle
the terms of an agreement with the Government;
and he had lived in that cabin six years, and on
the present reservation ever since it was established.</p>
<p>All this information came out reluctantly, and
with as little use of vital breath as possible. When
they had moved on out of earshot, Oscar expressed
his decided opinion that that settler was no more
like James Fenimore Cooper&#8217;s Indians than the
lovely Quindaro appeared to be. &#8220;Why, did you
notice, father,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that he actually
had on high-heeled boots? Think of that! An
Indian with high-heeled boots! Why, in Cooper&#8217;s
novels they wear moccasins, and some of them go
barefoot. These Indians are not worthy of the
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will see more of the same sort before we
get to the river,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;They have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
meeting-house up yonder, by the fork of the road,
I am told. And, seeing that this is our first day
out of camp on the last stage of our journey, suppose
we stop for dinner at Indian John&#8217;s, Aleck?
It will be a change from camp-fare, and they say
that John keeps a good table.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the delight of the lads, it was agreed that
they should make the halt as suggested, and noon
found them at a very large and comfortable &#8220;double
cabin,&#8221; as these peculiar structures are called.
Two log-cabins are built, end to end, with one roof
covering the two. The passage between them is
floored over, and affords an open shelter from rain
and sun, and in hot weather is the pleasantest
place about the establishment. Indian John&#8217;s
cabin was built of hewn logs, nicely chinked in
with slivers, and daubed with clay to keep out the
wintry blasts. As is the manner of the country,
one of the cabins was used for the rooms of the
family, while the dining-room and kitchen were in
the other end of the structure. Indian John regularly
furnished dinner to the stage passengers
going westward from Quindaro; for a public conveyance,
a &#8220;mud-wagon,&#8221; as it was called, had
been put on this part of the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a tuck-out I had!&#8221; said Sandy, after a
very bountiful and well-cooked dinner had been
disposed of by the party. &#8220;And who would have
supposed we should ever sit down to an Indian&#8217;s
table and eat fried chicken, ham and eggs, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
corn-dodger, from a regular set of blue-and-white
plates, and drink good coffee from crockery cups?
It just beats Father Dixon&#8217;s Indian stories all to
pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar and Charlie, however, were disposed to
think very lightly of this sort of Indian civilization.
Oscar said: &#8220;If these red men were either
one thing or the other, I wouldn&#8217;t mind it. But
they have shed the gaudy trappings of the wild
Indian, and their new clothes do not fit very well.
As Grandfather Bryant used to say, they are
neither fish nor flesh, nor good red herring. They
are a mighty uninteresting lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they are on the way to a better state
of things than they have known, anyhow,&#8221; said
Charlie. &#8220;The next generation will see them
higher up, I guess. But I must say that these
farms don&#8217;t look very thrifty, somehow. Indians
are a lazy lot; they don&#8217;t like work. Did you
notice how all those big fellows at dinner sat down
with us and the stage passengers, and the poor
women had to wait on everybody? That&#8217;s Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Charlie laughed, and said that the boys
had expected to find civilized Indians waiting on
the table, decked out with paint and feathers, and
wearing deerskin leggings and such like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until we get out on the frontier,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;and then you will see wild Indians, perhaps,
or &#8216;blanket Indians,&#8217; anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blanket Indians?&#8221; said Sandy, with an interrogation
point in his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s what the roving and unsettled
bands are called by white folks. Those that are
on reservations and earning their own living, or a
part of it,&ndash;&ndash;for the Government helps them out
considerably,&ndash;&ndash;are called town Indians; those
that live in wigwams, or tepees, and rove from
place to place, subsisting on what they can catch,
are blanket Indians. They tell me that there are
wild Indians out on the western frontier. But
they are not hostile; at least, they were not, at
last accounts. The Cheyennes have been rather
uneasy, they say, since the white settlers began to
pour into the country. Just now I am more concerned
about the white Missourians than I am
about the red aborigines.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were still on the Delaware reservation
when they camped that evening, and the boys went
into the woods to gather fuel for their fire.</p>
<p>They had not gone far, when Sandy gave a wild
whoop of alarm, jumping about six feet backward
as he yelled, &#8220;A rattlesnake!&#8221; Sure enough, an
immense snake was sliding out from under a mass
of brush that the boy had disturbed as he gathered
an armful of dry branches and twigs. Dropping
his burden, Sandy shouted, &#8220;Kill him! Kill him,
quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>The reptile was about five feet long, very thick,
and of a dark mottled color. Instantly, each lad
had armed himself with a big stick and had attacked
him. The snake, stopped in his attempt to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
away, turned, and opening his ugly-looking mouth,
made a curious blowing noise, half a hiss and half
a cough, as Charlie afterward described it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care, Sandy! He&#8217;ll spring at you, and
bite you in the face! See! He&#8217;s getting ready to
spring!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, indeed, the creature, frightened, and surrounded
by the agile, jumping boys, each armed
with a club, seemed ready to defend his life with
the best weapons at his command. The boys,
excited and alarmed, were afraid to come near the
snake, and were dancing about, waiting for a chance
to strike, when they were startled by a shot from
behind them, and the snake, making one more
effort to turn on himself, shuddered and fell dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell, hearing the shouting of the boys,
had run out of the camp, and with a well-directed
rifle shot had laid low the reptile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a blow-snake,&#8221; he said, taking the
creature by the tail and holding it up to view.
&#8220;He&#8217;s harmless. Well! Of course a dead snake
is harmless, but when he was alive he was not the
sort of critter to be afraid of. I thought you had
encountered a bear, at the very least, by the racket
you made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a big fellow, anyhow,&#8221; said Oscar, giving
the snake a kick, &#8220;and Sandy said he was a rattlesnake.
I saw a rattler once when we lived in
Dixon. Billy Everett and I found him down on
the bluff below the railroad; and he was spotted
all over. Besides, this fellow hasn&#8217;t any rattles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The boys have been having a lesson in natural
history, Charlie,&#8221; said Mr. Howell to his brother-in-law,
as they returned with him to camp, loaded
with firewood; Sandy, boy-like, dragging the dead
blow-snake after him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>TIDINGS FROM THE FRONT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Supper was over, a camp-fire built (for the emigrants
did their cooking by a small camp-stove, and
sat by the light of a fire on the ground), when out
of the darkness came sounds of advancing teams.
Oscar was playing his violin, trying to pick out a
tune for the better singing of Whittier&#8217;s song of
the Kansas Emigrants. His father raised his hand
to command silence. &#8220;That&#8217;s a Yankee teamster,
I&#8217;ll be bound,&#8221; he said, as the &#8220;Woh-hysh! Woh-haw!&#8221;
of the coming party fell on his ear. &#8220;No
Missourian ever talks to his cattle like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, a long, low emigrant wagon, or
&#8220;prairie schooner,&#8221; drawn by three yoke of dun-colored
oxen, toiled up the road. In the wagon
was a faded-looking woman with two small children
clinging to her. Odds and ends of household
furniture showed themselves over her head from
within the wagon, and strapped on behind was a
coop of fowls, from which came a melancholy
cackle, as if the hens and chickens were weary of
their long journey. A man dressed in butternut-colored
homespun drove the oxen, and a boy about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
ten years old trudged behind the driver. In the
darkness behind these tramped a small herd of
cows and oxen driven by two other men, and a lad
about the age of Oscar Bryant. The new arrivals
paused in the road, surveyed our friends from
Illinois, stopped the herd of cattle, and then the
man who was driving the wagon said, with an unmistakable
New England twang, &#8220;Friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, most assuredly,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant,
with a smile. &#8220;I guess you have been having
hard luck, you appear to be so suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have, and that&#8217;s a fact. But we&#8217;re
main glad to be able to camp among friends.
Jotham, unyoke the cattle after you have driven
them into the timber a piece.&#8221; He assisted the
woman and children to get down from the wagon,
and one of the cattle-drivers coming up, drove the
team into the woods a short distance, and the tired
oxen were soon lying down among the underbrush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, we <i>have</i> had a pretty hard time getting
here. We are the last free-State men allowed
over the ferry at Parkville. Where be you from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are from Lee County, Illinois,&#8221; replied
Mr. Bryant. &#8220;We came in by the way of Parkville,
too, a day or two ago; but we stopped at
Quindaro. Did you come direct from Parkville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;We came up the
river in the first place, on the steamboat &#8216;Black
Eagle,&#8217; and when we got to Leavenworth, a big
crowd of Borderers, seeing us and another lot of
free-State men on the boat, refused to let us land.
We had to go down the river again. The captain
of the boat kicked up a great fuss about it, and
wanted to put us ashore on the other side of the
river; but the Missouri men wouldn&#8217;t have it.
They put a &#8216;committee,&#8217; as they called the two
men, on board the steamboat, and they made the
skipper take us down the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far down did you go?&#8221; asked Bryant, his
face reddening with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we told the committee that we came
through Ioway, and that to Ioway we must go; so
they rather let up on us, and set us ashore just
opposite Wyandotte. I was mighty &#8217;fraid they&#8217;d
make us swear we wouldn&#8217;t go back into Kansas
some other way; but they didn&#8217;t, and so we
stivered along the road eastwards after they set
us ashore, and then we fetched a half-circle around
and got into Parkville.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if you bought those clothes
that you have got on at Parkville,&#8221; said Mr.
Howell, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guess about right,&#8221; said the sad-colored
stranger. &#8220;A very nice sort of a man we met at
the fork of the road, as you turn off to go to Parkville
from the river road, told me that my clothes
were too Yankee. I wore &#8217;em all the way from
Woburn, Massachusetts, where we came from, and
I hated to give &#8217;em up. But discretion is better
than valor, I have heern tell; so I made the trade,
and here I am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We had no difficulty getting across at Parkville,&#8221;
said Mr. Bryant, &#8220;except that we did have
to go over in the night in a sneaking fashion that
I did not like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the stranger, &#8220;as a special
favor, they let us across, seeing that we had had
such hard luck. That&#8217;s a nice-looking fiddle you&#8217;ve
got there, sonny,&#8221; he abruptly interjected, as he
took Oscar&#8217;s violin from his unwilling hand. &#8220;I
used to play the fiddle once, myself,&#8221; he added.
Then, drawing the bow over the strings in a light
and artistic manner, he began to play &#8220;Bonnie
Doon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, John,&#8221; his wife said wearily, &#8220;it&#8217;s time
the children were under cover. Let go the fiddle
until we&#8217;ve had supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>John reluctantly handed back the violin, and
the newcomers were soon in the midst of their
preparations for the night&#8217;s rest. Later on in the
evening, John Clark, as the head of the party
introduced himself, came over to the Dixon camp,
and gave them all the news. Clark was one of
those who had been helped by the New England
Emigrant Aid Society, an organization with headquarters
in the Eastern States, and with agents in
the West. He had been fitted out at Council
Bluffs, Iowa, but for some unexplained reason had
wandered down as far south as Kansas City, and
there had boarded the &#8220;Black Eagle&#8221; with his
family and outfit. One of the two men with him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
was his brother; the other was a neighbor who
had cast in his lot with him. The tall lad was
John Clark&#8217;s nephew.</p>
<p>In one way or another, Clark had managed to
pick up much gossip about the country and what
was going on. At Tecumseh, where they would
be due in a day or two if they continued on this
road, an election for county officers was to be held
soon, and the Missourians were bound to get in
there and carry the election. Clark thought they
had better not go straight forward into danger.
They could turn off, and go west by way of
Topeka.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that would be worse than going to
Tecumseh,&#8221; interjected Charlie, who had modestly
kept out of the discussion. &#8220;Topeka is the free-State
capital, and they say that there is sure to be
a big battle there, sooner or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Bryant resolved that he would go west
by the way of Tecumseh, no matter if fifty thousand
Borderers were encamped there. He asked
the stranger if he had in view any definite point;
to which Clark replied that he had been thinking
of going up the Little Blue; he had heard that
there was plenty of good vacant land there, and
the land office would open soon. He had intended,
he said, to go to Manhattan, and start
from there; but since they had been so cowardly
as to change the name of the place, he had &#8220;rather
soured on it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Manhattan?&#8221; exclaimed Charlie, eagerly.
&#8220;Where is that place? We have asked a good
many people, but nobody can tell us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good reason why; they&#8217;ve gone and changed
the name. It used to be Boston, but the settlers
around there were largely from Missouri. The
company were Eastern men, and when they settled
on the name of Boston, it got around that they
were all abolitionists; and so they changed it to
Manhattan. Why they didn&#8217;t call it New York,
and be done with it, is more than I can tell. But
it was Boston, and it is Manhattan; and that&#8217;s all
I want to know about <i>that</i> place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant was equally sure that he did not want
to have anything to do with a place that had changed
its name through fear of anybody or anything.</p>
<p>Next day there was a general changing of minds,
however. It was Sunday, and the emigrants, a
God-fearing and reverent lot of people, did not
move out of camp. Others had come in during
the night, for this was a famous camping-place,
well known throughout all the region. Here were
wood, water, and grass, the three requisites for
campers, as they had already found. The country
was undulating, interlaced with creeks; and groves
of black-jack, oak, and cottonwood were here and
there broken by open glades that would be smiling
fields some day, but were now wild native
grasses.</p>
<p>There was a preacher in the camp, a good man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
from New England, who preached about the Pilgrim&#8217;s
Progress through the world, and the trials
he meets by the way. Oscar pulled his father&#8217;s
sleeve, and asked why he did not ask the preacher
to give out &#8220;The Kansas Emigrant&#8217;s Song&#8221; as a
hymn. Mr. Bryant smiled, and whispered that it
was hardly likely that the lines would be considered
just the thing for a religious service. But
after the preaching was over, and the little company
was breaking up, he told the preacher what
Oscar had said. The minister&#8217;s eyes sparkled,
and he replied, &#8220;What? Have you that beautiful
hymn? Let us have it now and here. Nothing
could be better for this day and this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar, blushing with excitement and native
modesty, was put up high on the stump of a tree,
and, violin in hand, &#8220;raised the tune.&#8221; It was
grand old &#8220;Dundee.&#8221; Almost everybody seemed
to know the words of Whittier&#8217;s poem, and beneath
the blue Kansas sky, amid the groves of Kansas
trees, the sturdy, hardy men and the few pale
women joyfully, almost tearfully, sang,&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was good to be there,&#8221; said Alexander
Howell, his hand resting lovingly on Oscar&#8217;s
shoulder, as they went back to camp. But Oscar&#8217;s
father said never a word. His face was turned to
the westward, where the sunlight was fading behind
the hills of the far-off frontier of the Promised
Land.</p>

<p>The general opinion gathered that day was that
they who wanted to fight for freedom might better
go to Lawrence, or to Topeka. Those who were
bent on finding homes for themselves and little
ones should press on further to the west, where
there was land in plenty to be had for the asking,
or, rather, for the pre-empting. So, when Monday
morning came, wet, murky, and depressing, Bryant
surrendered to the counsels of his brother-in-law
and the unspoken wish of the boys, and agreed to
go on to the newly-surveyed lands on the tributaries
of the Kaw. They had heard good reports
of the region lying westward of Manhattan and
Fort Riley. The town that had changed its name
was laid out at the confluence of the Kaw and
the Big Blue. Fort Riley was some eighteen or
twenty miles to the westward, near the junction of
the streams that form the Kaw, known as Smoky
Hill Fork and the Republican Fork. On one or
the other of these forks, the valleys of which were
said to be fertile and beautiful beyond description,
the emigrants would find a home. So, braced and
inspired by the consciousness of having a definite
and settled plan, the Dixon party set forth on
Monday morning, through the rain and mist, with
faces to the westward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>WESTWARD HO!</h3>
</div>
<p>The following two or three days were wet and
uncomfortable. Rain fell in torrents at times, and
when it did not rain the ground was steamy,
and the emigrants had a hard time to find spots
dry enough on which to make up their beds at
night. This was no holiday journey, and the boys,
too proud to murmur, exchanged significant nods
and winks when they found themselves overtaken
by the discomforts of camping and travelling in
the storm. For the most part, they kept in camp
during the heaviest of the rain. They found that
the yokes of the oxen chafed the poor animals&#8217;
necks when wet.</p>
<p>And then the mud! Nobody had ever seen such
mud, they thought, not even on the black and
greasy fat lands of an Illinois prairie. Sometimes
the wagon sunk in the road, cut up by innumerable
wheels, so that the hubs of their wheels were
almost even with the surface, and it was with the
greatest difficulty that their four yoke of oxen
dragged the wagon from its oozy bed. At times,
too, they were obliged to unhitch their team and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
help out of a mud-hole some other less fortunate
brother wayfarer, whose team was not so powerful
as their own.</p>
<p>One unlucky day, fording a narrow creek with
steep banks, they had safely got across, when they
encountered a slippery incline up which the oxen
could not climb; it was &#8220;as slippery as a glare of
ice,&#8221; Charlie said, and the struggling cattle sank
nearly to their knees in their frantic efforts to
reach the top of the bank. The wagon had been
&#8220;blocked up,&#8221; that is to say, the wagon-box raised
in its frame or bed above the axles, with blocks
driven underneath, to lift it above the level of the
stream. As the vehicle was dragged out of the
creek, the leading yoke of cattle struggling up
the bank and then slipping back again, the whole
team of oxen suddenly became panic-stricken, as
it were, and rushed back to the creek in wild confusion.
The wagon twisted upon itself, and cramped
together, creaked, groaned, toppled, and fell over
in a heap, its contents being shot out before and
behind into the mud and water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; yelled Sandy. &#8220;Let me stop
those cattle!&#8221; Whereupon the boy dashed through
the water, and, running around the hinder end of
the wagon, he attempted to head off the cattle.
But the animals, having gone as far as they could
without breaking their chains or the wagon-tongue,
which fortunately held, stood sullenly by the side
of the wreck they had made, panting with their
exertions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a mess!&#8221; said his father; but, without
more words, he unhitched the oxen and drove
them up the bank. The rest of the party hastily
picked up the articles that were drifting about, or
were lodged in the mud of the creek. It was a
sorry sight, and the boys forgot, in the excitement
of the moment, the discomforts and annoyances
of their previous experiences. This was a real
misfortune.</p>
<p>But while Oscar and Sandy were excitedly discussing
what was next to be done, Mr. Howell
took charge of things; the wagon was righted,
and a party of emigrants, camped in a grove of
cottonwoods just above the ford, came down with
ready offers of help. Eight yoke of cattle instead
of four were now hitched to the wagon, and, to
use the expressive language of the West, the outfit
was &#8220;snaked&#8221; out of the hole in double-quick
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho, ho! Uncle Charlie,&#8221; laughed Sandy,
&#8220;you look as if you had been dragged through
a slough. You are just painted with mud from
top to toe. Well, I never did see such a looking
scarecrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky you haven&#8217;t any looking-glass here,
young Impudence. If you could see your mother&#8217;s
boy now, you wouldn&#8217;t know him. Talk about
looks! Take a look at the youngster, mates,&#8221;
said Uncle Charlie, bursting into a laugh. A general
roar followed the look, for Sandy&#8217;s appearance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
was indescribable. In his wild rush through the
waters of the creek, he had covered himself from
head to foot, and the mud from the wagon had
painted his face a brilliant brown; for there is
more or less of red oxide of iron in the mud of
Kansas creeks.</p>
<p>It was a doleful party that pitched its tent that
night on the banks of Soldier Creek and attempted
to dry clothes and provisions by the feeble heat of
a little sheet-iron stove. Only Sandy, the irrepressible
and unconquerable Sandy, preserved his
good temper through the trying experience. &#8220;It
is a part of the play,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and anybody who
thinks that crossing the prairie, &#8216;as of old the pilgrims
crossed the sea,&#8217; is a Sunday-school picnic,
might better try it with the Dixon emigrants;
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, after a very moist and disagreeable night,
the sky cleared in the morning. Oscar was out
early, looking at the sky; and when he shouted
&#8220;Westward ho!&#8221; with a stentorian voice, everybody
came tumbling out to see what was the matter.
A long line of white-topped wagons with
four yoke of oxen to each, eleven teams all told,
was stringing its way along the muddy road in
which the red sun was reflected in pools of red
liquid mud. The wagons were overflowing with
small children; coops of fowls swung from behind,
and a general air of thriftiness seemed to be characteristic
of the company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which way are you bound?&#8221; asked Oscar,
cheerily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the Smoky Hill Fork,&#8221; replied one of the
ox-drivers. &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s Fork, perhaps, but somewhere
in that region, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the company lingered behind to see what
manner of people these were who were so comfortably
camped out in a wall-tent. When he had
satisfied his curiosity, he explained that his companions
had come from northern Ohio, and were
bound to lay out a town of their own in the Smoky
Hill region. Oscar, who listened while his father
drew this information from the stranger, recalled
the fact that the Smoky Hill and the Republican
Forks were the branches of the Kaw. Solomon&#8217;s
Fork, he now learned, was one of the tributaries of
the Smoky Hill, nearer to the Republican Fork
than to the main stream. So he said to his father,
when the Ohio man had passed on: &#8220;If they settle
on Solomon&#8217;s Fork, won&#8217;t they be neighbors of
ours, daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant took out a little map of the Territory
that he had in his knapsack, and, after some
study, made up his mind that the newcomers
would not be &#8220;neighbors enough to hurt,&#8221; if they
came no nearer the Republican than Solomon&#8217;s
Fork. About thirty-five miles west and south of
Fort Riley, which is at the junction of the Smoky
Hill and the Republican, Solomon&#8217;s Fork branches
off to the northwest. Settlers anywhere along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
that line would not be nearer the other fork than
eighteen or twenty miles at the nearest. Charlie
and Sandy agreed with Oscar that it was quite as
near as desirable neighbors should be. The lads
were already learning something of the spirit of
the West. They had heard of the man who had
moved westward when another settler drove his
stakes twenty miles from his claim, because the
country was &#8220;gettin&#8217; too crowded.&#8221;</p>
<p>That day, passing through the ragged log village
of Tecumseh, they got their first letters from
home. When they left Illinois, they had not
known just where they would strike, in the Territory,
but they had resolved that they would not go
further west than Tecumseh; and here they were,
with their eyes still fixed toward the west. No
matter; just now, news from home was to be devoured
before anybody could talk of the possible
Kansas home that yet loomed before them in the dim
distance. How good it was to learn all about the
dear ones left at home; to find that Bose was keeping
guard around the house as if he knew that he
was the protector of the two mothers left to themselves
in one home; to hear that the brindle calf had
grown very large, and that a circus was coming to
town the very next day after the letter was written!</p>
<p>&#8220;That circus has come and gone without our
seeing it,&#8221; said Sandy, solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy is as good as a circus, any day,&#8221; said his
uncle, fondly. &#8220;The greatest show in the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
would have been willing to hire you for a sight,
fixed out as you were last night, after we had that
upset in the creek.&#8221; The boys agreed that it was
lucky for all hands that the only looking-glass in
camp was the little bit of one hidden away in
Uncle Charlie&#8217;s shaving-case.</p>
<p>The next day, to their great discomfiture, they
blundered upon a county election. Trudging into
Libertyville, one of the new mushroom towns
springing up along the military road that leads
from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Riley, they found
a great crowd of people gathered around a log-house
in which the polls were open. Country
officers were to be chosen, and the pro-slavery
men, as the Borderers were now called in this part
of the country, had rallied in great numbers to
carry the election for their men. All was confusion
and tumult. Rough-looking men, well armed
and generally loud voiced, with slouched hats and
long beards, were galloping about, shouting and
making all the noise possible, for no purpose that
could be discovered. &#8220;Hooray for Cap&#8217;n Pate!&#8221;
was the only intelligible cry that the newcomers
could hear; but who Captain Pate was, and why
he should be hurrahed for, nobody seemed to
know. He was not a candidate for anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo! there&#8217;s our Woburn friend, John
Clark,&#8221; said Mr. Howell. Sure enough, there he
was with a vote in his hand going up to the cabin
where the polls were open. A lane was formed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
through the crowd of men who lounged about the
cabin, so that a man going up to the door to vote
was obliged to run the gauntlet, as it were, of one
hundred men, or more, before he reached the door,
the lower half of which was boarded up and the
upper half left open for the election officers to
take and deposit the ballots.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that man has any right to vote
here,&#8221; said Charlie, with an expression of disgust
on his face. &#8220;Why, he came into the Territory
with us, only the other day, and he said he was
going up on the Big Blue to settle, and here he is
trying to vote!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Uncle Charlie, &#8220;I allow he has
just as good a right to vote as any of these men
who are running the election. I saw some of
these very men come riding in from Missouri,
when we were one day out of Quindaro.&#8221; As he
spoke, John Clark had reached the voting-place,
pursued by many rough epithets flung after him.</p>
<p>He paused before the half-barricaded door and
presented his ballot. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see yer ticket!&#8221;
shouted one of the men who stood guard, one
either side of the cabin-door. He snatched it from
Clark&#8217;s hand, looked at it, and simply said, &#8220;H&#8217;ist!&#8221;
The man on the other side of the would-be voter
grinned; then both men seized the Woburn man
by his arms and waist, and, before he could realize
what was happening, he was flung up to the edge
of the roof that projected over the low door. Two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
other men sitting there grabbed the newcomer by
the shoulders and passed him up the roof to two
others, who, straddling the ridge-pole, were waiting
for him. Then the unfortunate Clark disappeared
over the top of the cabin, sliding down out
of sight on the farther side. The mob set up a
wild cheer, and some of them shouted, &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want any Yankee votes in this yer &#8217;lection!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shameful! Shameful!&#8221; burst forth from Mr.
Bryant. &#8220;I have heard of such things before
now, but I must say I never thought I should see
it.&#8221; He turned angrily to his brother-in-law as
Mr. Howell joined the boys in their laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you laugh at such a shameful sight,
Aleck Howell? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s something to cry
over, rather than to laugh at&ndash;&ndash;a spectacle like
that! A free American citizen hustled away from
the polls in that disgraceful fashion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Charlie,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck, &#8220;you&#8217;ll admit
that it was funny to see the Woburn man hoisted
over that cabin. Besides, I don&#8217;t believe he has
any right to vote here; do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have been allowed to vote fast
enough if he had had the sort of ballot that those
fellows want to go into the box. They looked at
his ballot, and as soon as they saw what it was,
they threw him over the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, John Clark came back from the
ravine into which he had slid from the roof of the
log-house, looking very much crestfallen. He
explained that he had met some pro-slavery men on
the road that morning, and they had told him he
could vote, if he chose, and they had furnished
him with the necessary ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took in my clothes at a glance,&#8221; said
Clark, &#8220;and they seemed to suppose that a man
with butternut homespun was true-blue; so they
didn&#8217;t ask any questions. I got a free-State ballot
from another man and was a-goin&#8217; to plump it in;
but they were too smart for me, and over I went.
No, don&#8217;t you worry; I ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; up there to try
it ag&#8217;in,&#8221; he said, angrily, to an insolent horseman,
who, riding up, told him not to venture near the
polls again if he &#8220;did not want to be kicked out
like a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, neighbor; let&#8217;s be goin&#8217;,&#8221; he said to
Uncle Aleck. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough voting for to-day.
Let&#8217;s light out of this town.&#8221; Then the
men, taking up their ox-goads, drove out of town.
They had had their first sight of the struggle for
freedom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>AT THE DIVIDING OF THE WAYS.</h3>
</div>
<p>The military road, of which I have just spoken,
was constructed by the United States Government
to connect the military posts of the Far West with
one another. Beginning at Fort Leavenworth, on
the Missouri River, it passed through Fort Riley
at the junction of the forks of the Kaw, and then,
still keeping up the north side of the Republican
Fork, went on to Fort Kearney, still farther west,
then to Fort Laramie, which in those days was so
far on the frontier of our country that few people
ever saw it except military men and the emigrants
to California. At the time of which I am writing,
there had been a very heavy emigration to California,
and companies of emigrants, bound to the
Golden Land, still occasionally passed along the
great military road.</p>
<p>Interlacing this highway were innumerable trails
and wagon-tracks, the traces of the great migration
to the Eldorado of the Pacific; and here and there
were the narrow trails made by Indians on their
hunting expeditions and warlike excursions. Roads,
such as our emigrants had been accustomed to in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Illinois, there were none. First came the faint
traces of human feet and of unshod horses and
ponies; then the well-defined trail of hunters,
trappers, and Indians; then the wagon-track of the
military trains, which, in course of time, were
smoothed and formed into the military road kept
in repair by the United States Government.</p>
<p>Following this road, the Dixon emigrants came
upon the broad, bright, and shallow stream of the
Big Blue. Fording this, they drove into the rough,
new settlement of Manhattan, lately built at the
junction of the Blue and the Kaw rivers.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful May day when the travellers
entered Manhattan. It was an active and a promising
town. Some attempt at the laying out of
streets had been made. A long, low building,
occupied as a hotel, was actually painted, and on
some of the shanties and rude huts of the newly
arrived settlers were signs giving notice of hardware,
groceries, and other commodities for sale
within. On one structure, partly made of sawed
boards and partly of canvas, was painted in sprawling
letters, &#8220;Counsellor at Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find those fellows out in the Indian
country,&#8221; grimly remarked one of the settlers, as
the party surveyed this evidence of an advancing
civilization.</p>
<p>There was a big steam saw-mill hard by the
town, and the chief industry of Manhattan seemed
to be the buying and selling of lumber and hardware,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and the surveying of land. Mounted men,
carrying the tools and instruments of the surveyor,
galloped about. Few wheeled vehicles except the
ox-carts of emigrants were to be seen anywhere,
and the general aspect of the place was that of
feverish activity. Along the banks of the two
streams were camped parties of the latest comers,
many of whom had brought their wives and children
with them. Parties made up of men only seldom
came as far west as this. They pitched their
tents nearer the Missouri, where the fight for
freedom raged most hotly. A few companies of
men did reach the westernmost edge of the new
settlements, and the Manhattan Company was one
of these.</p>
<p>The three boys from Illinois were absorbed with
wonder as they strolled around the new town,
taking in the novel sights, as they would if they
had been in a great city, instead of a mushroom
town that had arisen in a night. During their
journey from Libertyville to Manhattan, the Dixon
emigrants had lost sight of John Clark, of Woburn;
he had hurried on ahead after his rough experience
with the election guardians of Libertyville. The
boys were wondering if he had reached Manhattan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo! There he is now, with all his family
around him,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;He&#8217;s got here before
us, and can tell all about the lay of the land to the
west of us, I dare say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have about made up my mind to squat on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Hunter&#8217;s Creek,&#8221; said Clark, when the boys had
saluted him. &#8220;Pretty good land on Hunter&#8217;s, so
I am told; no neighbors, and the land has been
surveyed off by the Government surveyors. Hunter&#8217;s
Creek? Well, that&#8217;s about six miles above
the fort. It makes into the Republican, and, so
they tell me, there&#8217;s plenty of wood along the
creek, and a good lot of oak and hickory not far
off. Timber is what we all want, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Bartlett, who had come out from New
England with the Clarks, he was inclined to go to
the lower side of the Republican Fork, taking to
the Smoky Hill country. That was the destination
of the Jenness party, who had passed the
Dixon boys when they were camped after their
upset in the creek, several days before. This
would leave the Clarks&ndash;&ndash;John and his wife and
two children, and his brother Jotham, and Jotham&#8217;s
boy, Pelatiah&ndash;&ndash;to make a settlement by themselves
on Hunter&#8217;s Creek.</p>
<p>Which way were the Dixon boys going? Charlie,
the spokesman of the party because he was the
eldest, did not know. His father and uncle were
out prospecting among the campers now. Sandy
was sure that they would go up the Republican
Fork. His father had met one of the settlers from
that region, and had been very favorably impressed
with his report. This Republican Fork man was
an Arkansas man, but &#8220;a good fellow,&#8221; so Sandy
said. To be a good fellow, according to Sandy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
way of putting things, was to be worthy of all
confidence and esteem.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant thought that as there were growing
rumors of troublesome Indians, it would be better
to take the southern or Smoky Hill route; the
bulk of the settlers were going that way, and where
there were large numbers there would be safety.
While the lads were talking with the Clarks,
Bryant and his brother-in-law came up, and, after
greeting their former acquaintance and ascertaining
whither he was bound, Mr. Howell told the boys
that they had been discussing the advantages of
the two routes with Younkins, the settler from
Republican Fork, and had decided to go on to
&#8220;the post,&#8221; as Fort Riley was generally called,
and there decide which way they should go&ndash;&ndash;to
the right or to the left.</p>
<p>As to the Clarks, they were determined to take
the trail for Hunter&#8217;s Creek that very day. Bartlett
decided to go to the Smoky Hill country. He
cast in his lot with a party of Western men, who
had heard glowing reports of the fertility and
beauty of the region lying along Solomon&#8217;s Fork,
a tributary of the Smoky Hill. It was in this way
that parties split up after they had entered the
Promised Land.</p>
<p>Leaving the Clarks to hitch up their teams and
part company with Bartlett, the Dixon party returned
to their camp, left temporarily in the care
of Younkins, who had come to Manhattan for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
few supplies, and who had offered to guide the
others to a desirable place for settlement which
he told them he had in mind for them. Younkins
was a kindly and pleasant-faced man, simple in his
speech and frontier-like in his manners. Sandy
conceived a strong liking for him as soon as they
met. The boy and the man were friends at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; said Younkins, sitting down
on the wagon-tongue, when the party had returned
to their camp, &#8220;I have been thinking over-like the
matter that we were talking about, and I have
made up my mind-like that I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t move back to
my claim on the south side of the Republican. I&#8217;m
on the north side, you know, and my old claim on
the south side will do just right for my brother
Ben; he&#8217;s coming out in the fall. Now if you
want to go up our way, you can have the cabin on
that claim. There&#8217;s nobody living in it. It&#8217;s no
great of a cabin, but it&#8217;s built of hewed timber,
well chinked and comfortable-like. You can have
it till Ben comes out, and I&#8217;m just a-keeping it for
Ben, you know. P&#8217;raps he won&#8217;t want it, and if
he doesn&#8217;t, why, then you and he can make some
kind of a dicker-like, and you might stay on till
you could do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very generous offer of Mr. Younkins&#8217;s,
Charles,&#8221; said Mr. Howell to Bryant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe we could do better than take it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; burst in the impetuous Sandy.
&#8220;Why, just think of it! A house already built!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Little boys should be seen, not heard,&#8221; said his
elder brother, reprovingly. &#8220;Suppose you and I
wait to see what the old folks have to say before
we chip in with any remarks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what Uncle Charlie will say,&#8221;
replied the lad, undismayed. &#8220;He&#8217;ll say that the
Smoky Hill road is the road to take. Say, Uncle
Charlie, you see that Mr. Younkins here is willing
to live all alone on the bank of the Republican
Fork, without any neighbors at all. He isn&#8217;t afraid
of Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant smiled, and said that he was not
afraid of Indians, but he thought that there might
come a time when it would be desirable for a community
to stand together as one man. &#8220;Are you
a free-State man?&#8221; he asked Younkins. This
was a home-thrust. Younkins came from a slave
State; he was probably a pro-slavery man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m neither a free-State man nor yet a pro-slavery
man,&#8221; he said, slowly, and with great deliberation.
&#8220;I&#8217;m just for Younkins all the time.
Fact is,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;where I came from most
of us are pore whites. I never owned but one
darky, and I had him from my grandfather. Ben
and me, we sorter quarrelled-like over that darky.
Ben, he thought he oughter had him, and I
knowed my grandfather left him to me. So I sold
him off, and the neighbors didn&#8217;t seem to like it.
I don&#8217;t justly know why they didn&#8217;t like it; but
they didn&#8217;t. Then Ben, he allowed that I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
better light out. So I lit out, and here I am. No,
I&#8217;m no free-State man, and then ag&#8217;in, I&#8217;m no
man for slavery. I&#8217;m just for Younkins. Solomon
Younkins is my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bryant was very clearly prejudiced in favor
of the settler from the Republican Fork by this
speech; and yet he thought it best to move on to
the fort that day and take the matter into consideration.</p>
<p>So he said that if Younkins would accept the
hospitality of their tent, the Dixon party would
be glad to have him pass the night with them.
Younkins had a horse on which he had ridden
down from his place, and with which he had intended
to reach home that night. But, for the
sake of inducing the new arrivals to go up into his
part of the country, he was willing to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would be afraid to leave
your wife and baby all alone there in the wilderness,&#8221;
said Sandy, regarding his new friend with
evident admiration. &#8220;No neighbor nearer than
Hunter&#8217;s Creek, did you say? How far off is
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a matter of six miles-like,&#8221; replied Younkins.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t often that I do leave them alone
over night; but then I have to once in a while.
My old woman, she doesn&#8217;t mind it. She was sort
of skeary-like when she first came into the country;
but she&#8217;s got used to it. We don&#8217;t want any
neighbors. If you folks come up to settle, you&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
be on the other side of the river,&#8221; he said, with
unsmiling candor. &#8220;That&#8217;s near enough&ndash;&ndash;three
or four miles, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Riley is about ten miles from Manhattan,
at the forks of the Kaw. It was a long drive for
one afternoon; but the settlers from Illinois camped
on the edge of the military reservation that night.
When the boys, curious to see what the fort was
like, looked over the premises next morning, they
were somewhat disappointed to find that the post
was merely a quadrangle of buildings constructed
of rough-hammered stone. A few frame houses
were scattered about. One of these was the sutler&#8217;s
store, just on the edge of the reservation.
But, for the most part, the post consisted of two-
or three-story buildings arranged in the form of
a hollow square. These were barracks, officers&#8217;
quarters, and depots for the storage of military
supplies and army equipments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is no fort!&#8221; said Oscar, contemptuously.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t even a stockade. What&#8217;s to
prevent a band of Indians raiding through the
whole place? I could take it myself, if I had men
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cousin Charlie laughed, and said: &#8220;Forts
are not built out here nowadays to defend a garrison.
The army men don&#8217;t propose to let the
Indians get near enough to the post to threaten
it. The fact is, I guess, this fort is only a depot-like,
as our friend Younkins would say, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
soldiers and for military stores. They don&#8217;t expect
ever to be besieged here; but if there should
happen to be trouble anywhere along the frontier,
then the soldiers would be here, ready to fly out
to the rescue, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Sandy; &#8220;and when a part of
the garrison had gone to the rescue, as you call
it, another party of redskins would swoop down
and gobble up the remnant left at the post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you, Master Sandy,&#8221; said his brother,
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry about the soldiers. Uncle Sam
built this fort, and there are lots of others like it.
I don&#8217;t know for sure, but my impression is that
Uncle Sam knows what is best for the use of the
military and for the defence of the frontier. So
let&#8217;s go and take a look at the sutler&#8217;s store. I
want to buy some letter-paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sutler, in those days, was a very important
person in the estimation of the soldiers of a frontier
post. Under a license from the War Department
of the Government, he kept a store in which
was everything that the people at the post could
possibly need. Crowded into the long building
of the Fort Riley sutler were dry-goods, groceries,
hardware, boots and shoes, window-glass, rope
and twine, and even candy of a very poor sort.
Hanging from the ceiling of this queer warehouse
were sides of smoked meat, strings of onions, oilcloth
suits, and other things that were designed
for the comfort or convenience of the officers and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
soldiers, and were not provided by the Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what soldiers want of calico and
ribbons,&#8221; whispered Sandy, with a suppressed
giggle, as the three lads went prying about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Officers and soldiers have their wives and
children here, you greeny,&#8221; said his brother,
sharply. &#8220;Look out there and see &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, as Sandy&#8217;s eyes followed the
direction of his brother&#8217;s, he saw two prettily
dressed ladies and a group of children walking
over the smooth turf that filled the square in the
midst of the fort. It gave Sandy a homesick
feeling, this sight of a home in the wilderness.
Here were families of grown people and children,
living apart from the rest of the world. They
had been here long before the echo of civil strife
in Kansas had reached the Eastern States, and
before the first wave of emigration had touched
the head-waters of the Kaw. Here they were,
a community by themselves, uncaring, apparently,
whether slavery was voted up or down. At least,
some such thought as this flitted through Sandy&#8217;s
mind as he looked out upon the leisurely life of
the fort, just beginning to stir.</p>
<p>All along the outer margin of the reservation
were grouped the camps of emigrants; not many
of them, but enough to present a curious and
picturesque sight. There were a few tents, but
most of the emigrants slept in or under their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
wagons. There were no women or children in
these camps, and the hardy men had been so well
seasoned by their past experiences, journeying to
this far western part of the Territory, that they
did not mind the exposure of sleeping on the
ground and under the open skies. Soldiers from
the fort, off duty and curious to hear the news
from the outer world, came lounging around the
camps and chatted with the emigrants in that
cool, superior manner that marks the private soldier
when he meets a civilian on equal footing,
away from the haunts of men.</p>
<p>The boys regarded these uniformed military
servants of the Government of the United States
with great respect, and even with some awe.
These, they thought to themselves, were the men
who were there to fight Indians, to protect the
border, and to keep back the rising tide of wild
hostilities that might, if it were not for them,
sweep down upon the feeble Territory and even
inundate the whole Western country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps some of Black Hawk&#8217;s descendants
are among the Indians on this very frontier,&#8221; said
Oscar, impressively. &#8220;And these gold-laced chaps,
with shoulder-straps on, are the Zack Taylors and
the Robert Andersons who do the fighting,&#8221; added
Charlie, with a laugh.</p>
<p>Making a few small purchases from the surly
sutler of Fort Riley, and then canvassing with the
emigrants around the reservation the question of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
routes and locations, our friends passed the forenoon.
The elders of the party had anxiously discussed
the comparative merits of the Smoky Hill
and the Republican Fork country and had finally
yielded to the attractions of a cabin ready-built
in Younkins&#8217;s neighborhood, with a garden patch
attached, and had decided to go in that direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is simply bully!&#8221; said Sandy Howell, as
the little caravan turned to the right and drove up
the north bank of the Republican Fork.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VIII_THE_SETTLERS_AT_HOME' id='CHAPTER_VIII_THE_SETTLERS_AT_HOME'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE SETTLERS AT HOME.</h3>
</div>
<p>A wide, shallow river, whose turbid waters were
yellow with the freshets of early summer, shadowed
by tall and sweeping cottonwoods and water-maples;
shores gently sloping to the current, save
where a tall and rocky bluff broke the prospect up
stream; thickets of oaks, alders, sycamores, and
persimmons&ndash;&ndash;this was the scene on which the Illinois
emigrants arrived, as they journeyed to their
new home in the far West. On the north bank of
the river, only a few hundred rods from the stream,
was the log-cabin of Younkins. It was built on
the edge of a fine bit of timber land, in which
oaks and hickories were mingled with less valuable
trees. Near by the cabin, and hugging closely up
to it, was a thrifty field of corn and other garden
stuff, just beginning to look promising of good
things to come; and it was a refreshing sight here
in the wilderness, for all around was the virgin
forest and the unbroken prairie.</p>
<p>Younkins&#8217;s wife, a pale, sallow, and anxious-looking
woman, and Younkins&#8217;s baby boy, chubby
and open-eyed, welcomed the strangers without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
much show of feeling other than a natural curiosity.
With Western hospitality, the little cabin
was found large enough to receive all the party,
and the floor was covered with blankets and buffalo-skins
when they lay down to sleep their first night
near their future home in the country of the Republican
Fork. The boys were very happy that
their journey was at an end. They had listened
with delight while Younkins told stories of buffalo
and antelope hunting, of Indian &#8220;scares,&#8221; and of
the many queer adventures of settlers on this distant
frontier.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there west of this?&#8221; asked Charlie,
as the party were dividing the floor and the shallow
loft among themselves for the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but Indians and buffalo,&#8221; said Younkins,
sententiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No settlers anywhere?&#8221; cried Sandy, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next settlement west of here, if you can
call it a settlement, is Fort Kearney, on the other
side of the Platte. From here to there, there isn&#8217;t
so much as a hunter&#8217;s camp, so far as I know.&#8221;
This was Younkins&#8217;s last word, as he tumbled,
half dressed, into his bunk in one corner of the
cabin. Sandy hugged his brother Charlie before
he dropped off to sleep, and whispered in his ear,
&#8220;We&#8217;re on the frontier at last! It&#8217;s just splendid!&#8221;</p>
<p>Next day, leaving their cattle and wagon at the
Younkins homestead, the party, piloted by their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
good-natured future neighbor, forded the Fork and
went over into the Promised Land. The river
was rather high as yet; for the snow, melting in
the far-off Rocky Mountains as the summer advanced,
had swollen all the tributaries of the
Republican Fork, and the effects of the rise were
to be seen far down on the Kaw. The newcomers
were initiated into the fashion of the country by
Younkins, who directed each one to take off all
clothes but his shirt and hat. Then their garments
were rolled up in bundles, each man and
boy taking his own on his head, and wading deliberately
into the water, the sedate Younkins being
the leader.</p>
<p>It seemed a little dangerous. The stream was
about one hundred rods wide, and the current was
tolerably swift, swollen by the inrush of smaller
streams above. The water was cold, and made an
ominous swishing and gurgling among the underbrush
that leaned into the margin of the river. In
Indian file, Mr. Howell bringing up the rear, and
keeping his eyes anxiously upon the lads before
him, they all crossed in safety, Sandy, the shortest
of the party, being unable to keep dry the only
garment he had worn, for the water came well up
under his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was funny, anyhow,&#8221; he blithely
remarked, as he wrung the water out of his shirt,
and, drying himself as well as he could, dressed
and joined the rest of the party in the trip toward
their future home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Along the lower bank of the Republican Fork,
where the new settlers now found themselves, the
country is gently undulating. Bordering the stream
they saw a dense growth of sycamores, cottonwoods,
and birches. Some of these trees were tall and
handsome, and the general effect on the minds of
the newcomers was delightful. After they had
emerged from the woods that skirted the river,
they were in the midst of a lovely rolling prairie,
the forest on the right; on their left was a thick
growth of wood that marked the winding course
of a creek which, rising far to the west, emptied
into the Republican Fork at a point just below
where the party had forded the stream. The land
rose gradually from the point nearest the ford,
breaking into a low, rocky bluff beyond at their
right and nearest the river, a mile away, and rolling
off to the southwest in folds and swales.</p>
<p>Just at the foot of the little bluff ahead, with
a background of trees, was a log-cabin of hewn
timber, weather-stained and gray in the summer
sun, absolutely alone, and looking as if lost in this
untrodden wild. Pointing to it, Younkins said,
&#8220;That&#8217;s your house so long as you want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The emigrants tramped through the tall, lush
grass that covered every foot of the new Kansas
soil, their eyes fixed eagerly on the log-cabin before
them. The latch-string hung out hospitably from
the door of split &#8220;shakes,&#8221; and the party entered
without ado. Everything was just as Younkins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
had last left it. Two or three gophers, disturbed
in their foraging about the premises, fled swiftly
at the entrance of the visitors, and a flock of blackbirds,
settled around the rear of the house, flew
noisily across the creek that wound its way down
to the Fork.</p>
<p>The floor was of puncheons split from oak logs,
and laid loosely on rough-hewn joists. These rattled
as the visitors walked over them. At one end
of the cabin a huge fireplace of stone laid in clay
yawned for the future comfort of the new tenants.
Near by, a rude set of shelves suggested a
pantry, and a table, home-made and equally rude,
stood in the middle of the floor. In one corner
was built a bedstead, two sides of the house furnishing
two sides of the work, and the other two
being made by driving a stake into the floor, and
connecting that by string-pieces to the sides of the
cabin. Thongs of buffalo-hide formed the bottom
of this novel bedstead. A few stools and short
benches were scattered about. Near the fireplace
long and strong pegs, driven into the logs, served
as a ladder, on which one could climb to the low
loft overhead. Two windows, each of twelve small
panes of glass, let in the light, one from the end
of the cabin, and one from the back opposite the
door, which was in the middle of the front. Outside,
a frail shanty of shakes leaned against the
cabin, affording a sort of outdoor kitchen for summer
use.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So this is home,&#8221; said Charlie, gazing about.
&#8220;What will mother say to this&ndash;&ndash;if she ever gets
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve taken a heap of comfort here, my
old woman and me,&#8221; said Younkins, looking around
quickly, and with an air of surprise. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty
comfortable house; leastways we think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie apologized for having seemed to cast any
discredit on the establishment. Only he said that
he did not suppose that his mother knew much
about log-cabins. As for himself, he would like
nothing better than this for a home for a long time
to come. &#8220;For,&#8221; he added, roguishly, &#8220;you know
we have come to make the West, &#8216;as they the
East, the homestead of the free.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Younkins looked puzzled, but made no remark.
The younger boys, after taking in the situation
and fondly inspecting every detail of the
premises, enthusiastically agreed that nothing could
be finer than this. They darted out of doors, and
saw a corral, or pound, in which the cattle could
be penned up, in case of need. There was a small
patch of fallow ground, that needed only to be
spaded up to become a promising garden-spot.
Then, swiftly running to the top of the little bluff
beyond, they gazed over the smiling panorama of
emerald prairie, laced with woody creeks, level
fields, as yet undisturbed by the ploughshare, blue,
distant woods and yet more distant hills, among
which, to the northwest, the broad river wound
and disappeared. Westward, nothing was to be
seen but the green and rolling swales of the virgin
prairie, broken here and there by an outcropping
of rock. And as they looked, a tawny, yellowish
creature trotted out from behind a roll of the
prairie, sniffed in the direction of the boys, and
then stealthily disappeared in the wildness of the
vast expanse.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;A coyote,&#8221; said Sandy, briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
them in Illinois. But I wish I had my gun now.&#8221;
His wiser brother laughed as he told him that it
would be a long day before a coyote could be got
near enough to be knocked over with any shot-gun.
The coyote, or prairie-wolf, is the slyest
animal that walks on four legs.</p>
<p>The three men and Charlie returned to the
further side of the Fork, and made immediate
preparations to move all their goods and effects
to the new home of the emigrants. Sandy and
Oscar, being rather too small to wade the stream
without discomfort, while it was so high, were left
on the south bank to receive the returning party.</p>
<p>There the boys sat, hugely enjoying the situation,
while the others were loading the wagon and
yoking the oxen on the other side. The lads
could hear the cheery sounds of the men talking,
although they could not see them through the
trees that lined the farther bank of the river. The
flow of the stream made a ceaseless lapping against
the brink of the shore. A party of catbirds quarrelled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
sharply in the thicket hard by; quail whistled
in the underbrush of the adjacent creek, and
overhead a solitary eagle circled slowly around as
if looking down to watch these rude invaders of
the privacy of the dominion that had existed ever
since the world began.</p>
<p>Hugging his knees in measureless content, as
they sat in the grass by the river, Sandy asked,
almost in a whisper, &#8220;Have you ever been homesick
since we left Dixon, Oscar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just once, Sandy; and that was yesterday
when I saw those nice-looking ladies at the fort
out walking in the morning with their children.
That was the first sight that looked like home
since we crossed the Missouri.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; answered Sandy, soberly. &#8220;But
this is just about as fine as anything can be. Only
think of it, Oscar! There are buffalo and antelopes
within ten or fifteen miles of here. I know,
for Younkins told me so. And Indians,&ndash;&ndash;not wild
Indians, but tame ones that are at peace with the
whites. It seems too good to have happened to
us; doesn&#8217;t it, Oscar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the wagon was blocked up for a difficult
ford, the lighter and more perishable articles
of its load being packed into a dugout, or canoe
hollowed from a sycamore log, which was the
property of Younkins, and used only at high stages
of the water. The three men guided the wagon
and oxen across while Charlie, stripped to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
shirt, pushed the loaded dugout carefully over,
and the two boys on the other bank, full of the
importance of the event, received the solitary voyager,
unloaded the canoe, and then transferred the
little cargo to the wagon. The caravan took its
way up the rolling ground of the prairie to the log-cabin.
Willing hands unloaded and took into the
house the tools, provisions, and clothes that constituted
their all, and, before the sun went down,
the settlers were at home.</p>
<p>While in Manhattan, they had supplied themselves
with potatoes; at Fort Riley they had
bought fresh beef from the sutler. Sandy made a
glorious fire in the long-disused fireplace. His
father soon had a batch of biscuits baking in the
covered kettle, or Dutch oven, that they had
brought with them from home. Charlie&#8217;s contribution
to the repast was a pot of excellent coffee,
the milk for which, an unaccustomed luxury, was
supplied by the thoughtfulness of Mrs. Younkins.
So, with thankful hearts, they gathered around
their frugal board and took their first meal in their
new home.</p>
<p>When supper was done and the cabin, now
lighted by the scanty rays of two tallow candles,
had been made tidy for the night, Oscar took out
his violin, and, after much needed tuning, struck
into the measure of wild, warbling &#8220;Dundee.&#8221;
All hands took the hint, and all voices were raised
once more to the words of Whittier&#8217;s song of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
&#8220;Kansas Emigrants.&#8221; Perhaps it was with new
spirit and new tenderness that they sang,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;No pause, nor rest, save where the streams<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the pilgrim&#8217;s gonfalon is,&#8221;
said Sandy, sleepily, &#8220;but I guess it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
The emigrants had crossed the prairies as of old
their father had crossed the sea. They were now
at home in the New West. The night fell dark
and still about their lonely cabin as, with hope and
trust, they laid them down to peaceful dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>SETTING THE STAKES.</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t let any grass grow under our feet,
boys,&#8221; was Mr. Aleck Howell&#8217;s energetic remark,
next morning, when the little party had finished
their first breakfast in their new home.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means work, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; replied Oscar,
turning a longing glance to his violin hanging on
the side of the cabin, with a broken string crying
for repairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and hard work, too,&#8221; said his father, noting
the lad&#8217;s look. &#8220;Luckily for us, Brother
Aleck,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;our boys are not afraid
of work. They have been brought up to it, and
although I am thinking they don&#8217;t know much
about the sort of work that we shall have to put
in on these beautiful prairies, I guess they will
buckle down to it. Eh?&#8221; and the loving father
turned his look from the grassy and rolling plain
to his son&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Sandy answered for him. &#8220;Oh, yes, Uncle
Charlie, we all like work! Afraid of work?
Why, Oscar and I are so used to it that we would
be willing to lie right down by the side of it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
sleep as securely as if it were as harmless as a
kitten! Afraid of work? Never you fear &#8216;the
Dixon boys who fear no noise&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s the rest
of that song?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody knew, and, in the laugh that followed,
Mr. Howell suggested that as Younkins was coming
over the river to show them the stakes of their
new claims, the boys might better set an extra plate
at dinner-time. It was very good of Younkins to
take so much trouble on their account, and the least
they could do was to show him proper hospitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is all this about stakes and quarter-sections,
anyway, father?&#8221; asked Sandy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know what quarter-sections are!&#8221;
shouted Charlie. &#8220;Oh, my! what an ignoramus!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is a quarter-section, as you are so
knowing?&#8221; demanded Sandy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
you know yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a quarter of a section of public land,&#8221;
answered the lad. &#8220;Every man or single woman
of mature age&ndash;&ndash;I think that is what the books
say&ndash;&ndash;who doesn&#8217;t own several hundred acres of
land elsewhere (I don&#8217;t know just how many) is
entitled to enter on and take up a quarter of a
section of unoccupied public land, and have it for
a homestead. That&#8217;s all,&#8221; and Charlie looked to
his father for approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good, Charlie,&#8221; said his uncle. &#8220;How
many acres are there in a quarter-section of land?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, how many acres in a quarter of a section?&#8221;
shouted Sandy, who saw that his brother
hesitated. &#8220;Speak up, my little man, and don&#8217;t
be afraid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the lad, frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Never be
afraid of saying that you don&#8217;t know when you do
<i>not</i> know. The fear of confessing ignorance is
what has wrecked many a young fellow&#8217;s chances
for finding out things he should know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant, addressing himself
to the three lads, &#8220;all the land of the United
States Government that is open to settlement is
laid off in townships six miles square. These, in
turn, are laid off into sections of six hundred and
forty acres each. Now, then, how much land
should there be in a quarter-section?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One hundred and sixty acres!&#8221; shouted all
three boys at once, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct. The Government allows every man,
or single woman of mature age, widow or unmarried,
to go upon a plot of land, not more than one
hundred and sixty acres nor less than forty acres,
and to improve it, and live upon it. If he stays
there, or &#8216;maintains a continuous residence,&#8217; as the
lawyers say, for a certain length of time, the Government
gives him a title-deed at the end of that
time, and he owns the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&ndash;&ndash;free, gratis, and for nothing?&#8221; cried
Sandy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said his uncle. &#8220;The homestead
law was passed by Congress to encourage the
settlement of the lands belonging to the Government.
You see there is an abundance of these
lands,&ndash;&ndash;so much, in fact, that they have not yet
been all laid off into townships and sections and
quarter-sections. If a large number of homestead
claims are taken up, then other settlers will be
certain to come in and buy the lands that the
Government has to sell; and that will make settlements
grow throughout that locality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should they buy when they can get land
for nothing by entering and taking possession, just
as we are going to do?&#8221; interrupted Oscar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, my son, many of the men cannot
make oath that they have not taken up Government
land somewhere else; and then, again, many
men are going into land speculations, and they
don&#8217;t care to wait five years to prove up a homestead
claim. So they go upon the land, stake out
their claim, and the Government sells it to them
outright at the rate of a dollar and a quarter an
acre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cash down?&#8221; asked Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they need not pay cash down unless they
choose. The Government allows them a year to
pay up in. But land speculators who make a
business of this sort of thing generally pay up
just as soon as they are allowed to, and then, if
they get a good offer to sell out, they sell and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
move off somewhere else, and do the same thing
over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have to pay fees, don&#8217;t they, Uncle
Charlie?&#8221; said Sandy. &#8220;I know they used to talk
about land-office fees, in Dixon. How much does
it cost in fees to enter a piece of Government
land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is about twenty-five dollars&ndash;&ndash;twenty-six,
to be exact,&#8221; replied Mr. Bryant. &#8220;There
comes Younkins,&#8221; he added, looking down the
trail to the river bank below.</p>
<p>The boys had been washing and putting away
the breakfast things while this conversation was
going on, and Sandy, balancing in the air a big
tin pan on his fingers, asked: &#8220;How much land
can we fellows enter, all told?&#8221; The two men
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Alexander,&#8221; said his father, ceremoniously,
&#8220;We two &#8216;fellows,&#8217; that is to say, your
Uncle Charlie and myself, can enter one hundred
and sixty acres apiece. Charlie will be able to
enter the same quantity three years from now,
when he will be twenty-one; and as for you and
Oscar, if you each add to your present years as
many as will make you twenty-one, you can tell
when you will be able to enter and own the same
amount of land; provided it is not all gone by
that time. Good morning, Mr. Younkins.&#8221; Sandy&#8217;s
pan came down with a crash on the puncheon floor.</p>
<p>The land around that region of the Republican
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Fork had been surveyed into sections of
six hundred and forty acres each; but it would
be necessary to secure the services of a local
surveyor to find out just where the boundaries
of each quarter-section were. The stakes were
set at the corner of each section, and Younkins
thought that by pacing off the distance between
two corners they could get at the point that
would mark the middle of the section; then, by
running lines across from side to side, thus:
<img alt='' src='images/set-box.png' />
they could get at the quarter-sections nearly
enough to be able to tell about where their boundaries
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose you should build a house, or
plough a field, on some other man&#8217;s quarter-section,&#8221;
suggested Charlie, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t you feel cheap
when the final survey showed that you had all
along been improving your neighbor&#8217;s property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any danger of that,&#8221; answered
Younkins, &#8220;if you are smart enough to keep well
away from your boundary line when you are putting
in your improvements. Some men are not
smart enough, though. There was a man over on
Chapman&#8217;s Creek who wanted to have his log-cabin
on a pretty rise of ground-like, that was on
the upper end of his claim. He knew that the line
ran somewhere about there; but he took chances-like,
and when the line was run, a year after that,
lo, and behold! his house and garden-like were
both clean over into the next man&#8217;s claim.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; asked Charlie. &#8220;Skip out
of the place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! No, indeed! His neighbor was a white
man-like, and they just took down the cabin and
carried it across the boundary line and set it up
again on the man&#8217;s own land. He&#8217;s livin&#8217; there
yet; but he lost his garden-like; couldn&#8217;t move
that, you see&#8221;; and Younkins laughed one of his
infrequent laughs.</p>
<p>The land open to the settlers on the south side
of the Republican Fork was all before them.
Nothing had been taken up within a distance as
far as they could see. Chapman&#8217;s Creek, just
referred to by Younkins, was eighteen or twenty
miles away. From the point at which they stood
and toward Chapman&#8217;s, the land was surveyed; but
to the westward the surveys ran only just across
the creek, which, curving from the north and west,
made a complete circuit around the land and
emptied into the Fork, just below the fording-place.
Inside of that circuit, the land, undulating,
and lying with a southern exposure, was destitute
of trees. It was rich, fat land, but there was not
a tree on it except where it crossed the creek, the
banks of which were heavily wooded. Inside of
that circuit somewhere, the two men must stake
out their claim. There was nothing but rich, unshaded
land, with a meandering woody creek flowing
through the bottom of the two claims, provided
they were laid out side by side. The corner stakes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
were found, and the men prepared to pace off the
distance between the corners so as to find the
centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pity there is no timber anywhere,&#8221; said
Howell, discontentedly. &#8220;We shall have to go
several miles for timber enough to build our cabins.
We don&#8217;t want to cut down right away what little
there is along the creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Timber?&#8221; said Younkins, reflectively. &#8220;Timber?
Well, if one of you would put up with a
quarter-section of farming land, then the other
can enter some of the timber land up on the North
Branch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the North Branch was two miles and a
half from the cabin in which the Dixon party were
camped; and that cabin was two miles from the
beautiful slopes on which the intending settlers
were now looking for an opportunity to lay out
their two claims. The two men looked at each
other. Could they divide and settle this far apart
for the sake of getting a timber lot?</p>
<p>It was Sandy who solved the problem. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you what to do, father!&#8221; he cried, eagerly:
&#8220;you take up the timber claim on the North
Branch, and we boys can live there; then you
and Uncle Charlie can keep one of the claims
here. We can build two cabins, and you old folks
can live in one, and we in another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fathers exchanged glances, and Mr. Howell
said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how I could live without Sandy
and Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>Younkins brightened up at Sandy&#8217;s suggestion;
and he added that the two men might take up two
farming claims, side by side, and let the boys try
and hold the timber claim on the North Branch.
Thus far, there was no rush of emigration to the
south side of the Republican Fork. Most of the
settlers went further to the south; or they halted
further east, and fixed their stakes along the line
of the Big Blue and other more accessible regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll chance it, won&#8217;t we, Aleck?&#8221; said Mr.
Bryant.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell looked vaguely off over the rolling
slope on which they were standing, and said: &#8220;We
will chance it with the boys on the timber land,
but I am not in favor of taking up two claims here.
Let the timber claim be in my name or yours, and
the boys can live on it. But we can&#8217;t take up two
claims here and the timber besides&ndash;&ndash;three in all&ndash;&ndash;with
only two full-grown men among the whole of
us. That stands to reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>Younkins was a little puzzled by the strictness
with which the two newcomers were disposed to
regard their rights and duties as actual settlers.
He argued that settlers were entitled to all they
could get and hold; and he was in favor of the
party&#8217;s trying to hold three claims of one hundred
and sixty acres each, even if there were only two
men legally entitled to enter homesteads. Wouldn&#8217;t
Charlie be of age before the time came to take out
a patent for the land?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he is not of age to enter upon and hold
the land now,&#8221; said his father, stiffly.</p>
<p>So it was settled that the two men should enter
upon the quarter-section of farming land, and build
a cabin as soon as convenient, and that the claim
on the North Fork, which had a fine grove of timber
on it, should be set apart for the boys, and a
cabin built there, too. The cabin in the timber
need not be built until late in the autumn; that
claim could be taken up by Mr. Howell, or by Mr.
Bryant; by and by they would draw lots to decide
which. Before sundown that night, they had
staked out the corners of the one hundred and
sixty acre lot of farming land, on which the party
had arrived in the morning.</p>
<p>It was dark before they returned from looking
over the timber land in the bend of the North Fork
of the Republican.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>DRAWING THE FIRST FURROW.</h3>
</div>
<p>The good-natured Younkins was on hand bright
and early the next morning, to show the new
settlers where to cut the first furrow on the land
which they had determined to plough. Having
decided to take the northwest corner of the quarter-section
selected, it was easy to find the stake set
at the corner. Then, having drawn an imaginary
line from the stake to that which was set in the
southwest corner, the tall Charlie standing where
he could he used as a sign for said landmark, his
father and his uncle, assisted by Younkins, and
followed by the two other boys, set the big breaking-plough
as near that line as possible. The four
yoke of oxen stood obediently in line. Mr. Howell
firmly held the plough-handles; Younkins drove
the two forward yoke of cattle, and Mr. Bryant the
second two; and the two younger boys stood ready
to hurrah as soon as the word was given to start.
It was an impressive moment to the youngsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee up!&#8221; shouted Younkins, as mildly as if
the oxen were petted children. The long train
moved; the sharp nose of the plough cut into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
virgin turf, turning over a broad sod, about five
inches thick; and then the plough swept onward
toward the point where Charlie stood waving his
red handkerchief in the air. Sandy seized a huge
piece of the freshly-turned sod, and swinging it over
his head with his strong young arms, he cried,
&#8220;Three cheers for the first sod of Bleeding Kansas!
&#8217;Rah! &#8217;Rah! &#8217;Rah!&#8221; The farming of the boy
settlers had begun.</p>
<p>Charlie, at his distant post on the other side of
the creek, saw the beginning of things, and sent
back an answering cheer to the two boys who were
dancing around the massive and slow-moving team
of cattle. The men smiled at the enthusiasm of
the youngsters, but in their hearts the two new
settlers felt that this was, after all, an event of
much significance. The green turf now being
turned over was disturbed by ploughshare for the
first time since the creation of the world. Scarcely
ever had this soil felt the pressure of the foot of a
white man. For ages unnumbered it had been
the feeding-ground of the buffalo and the deer.
The American savage had chased his game over
it, and possibly the sod had been wet with the
blood of contending tribes. Now all was to be
changed. As the black, loamy soil was turned for
the first time to the light of day, so for the first
time the long-neglected plain was being made
useful for the support of civilized man.</p>
<p>No wonder the boys cheered and cheered again.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>This is what was in Mr. Charles Bryant&#8217;s mind
as he wielded the ox-goad over the backs of the
animals that drew the great plough along the first
furrow cut on the farm of the emigrants. The
day was bright and fair; the sun shone down on
the flower-gemmed sod; no sound broke on the
still air but the slow treading of the oxen, the
chirrup of the drivers, the ripping of the sod as it
was turned in the furrow, and the gay shouts of
the light-hearted boys.</p>
<p>In a line of marvellous straightness, Younkins
guided the leading yoke of cattle directly toward
the creek on the other side of which Charlie yet
stood, a tall, but animated landmark. When, after
descending the gradual slope on which the land
lay, the trees that bordered the stream hid the lad
from view, it was decided that the furrow was
long enough to mark the westerly boundary line
of the forty acres which it was intended to break
up for the first corn-field on the farm. Then the
oxen were turned, with some difficulty, at right
angles with the line just drawn, and were driven
easterly until the southern boundary of the patch
was marked out. Turning, now, at right angles,
and tracing another line at the north, then again
to the west to the point of original departure, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
had accurately defined the outer boundaries of the
field on which so much in the future depended;
for here was to be planted the first crop of the
newcomers.</p>
<p>Younkins, having started the settlers in their
first farming, returned across the river to his own
plough, first having sat down with the Dixon
party to a substantial dinner. For the boys, after
the first few furrows were satisfactorily turned,
had gone back to the cabin and made ready the
noon meal. The ploughmen, when they came to
the cabin in answer to Sandy&#8217;s whoop from the
roof, had made a considerable beginning in the
field. They had gone around within the outer
edge of the plantation that was to be, leaving with
each circuit a broader band of black and shining
loam over which a flock of birds hopped and swept
with eager movements, snapping up the insects
and worms which, astonished at the great upheaval,
wriggled in the overturned turf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks sorter homelike here,&#8221; said Younkins,
with a pleased smile, as he drew his bench to the
well-spread board and glanced around at the walls
of the cabin, where the boys had already hung
their fishing-tackle, guns, Oscar&#8217;s violin, and a
few odds and ends that gave a picturesque look to
the long-deserted cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant, as he filled Younkins&#8217;s
tin cup with hot coffee, &#8220;our boys have all got the
knack of making themselves at home,&ndash;&ndash;runs in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
the blood, I guess,&ndash;&ndash;and if you come over here
again in a day or two, you will probably find us
with rugs on the floor and pictures on the walls.
Sandy is a master-hand at hunting; and he intends
to get a dozen buffalo-skins out of hand, so to
speak, right away.&#8221; And he looked fondly at his
freckled nephew as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dibble and a corn-dropper will be more in
his way than the rifle, for some weeks to come,&#8221;
said Mr. Howell.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a dibble?&#8221; asked both of the youngsters
at once.</p>
<p>The elder man smiled and looked at Younkins
as he said, &#8220;A dibble, my lambs, is an instrument
for the planting of corn. With it in one hand you
punch a hole in the sod that has been turned over,
and then, with the other hand, you drop in three
or four grains of corn from the corn-dropper, cover
it with your heel, and there you are,&ndash;&ndash;planted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I supposed we were going to plant corn
with a hoe; and we&#8217;ve got the hoes, too!&#8221; cried
Oscar.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my son,&#8221; said his father; &#8220;if we were to
plant corn with a hoe, we shouldn&#8217;t get through
planting before next fall, I am afraid. After dinner,
we will make some dibbles for you boys, for
you must begin to drop corn to-morrow. What
ploughing we have done to-day, you can easily catch
up with when you begin. And the three of you
can all be on the furrow at once, if that seems
worth while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>The boys very soon understood fully what a dibble
was, and what a corn-dropper was, strange
though those implements were to them at first.
Before the end of planting-time, they fervently
wished they had never seen either of these instruments
of the corn-planter.</p>
<p>With the aid of a few rude tools, there was fashioned
a staff from the tough hickory that grew
near at hand, the lower part of the stick being
thick and pointed at the end. The staff was about
as high as would come up to a boy&#8217;s shoulder, so
that as he grasped it near the upper end, his arm
being bent, the lower end was on the ground.</p>
<p>The upper end was whittled so as to make a
convenient handle for the user. The lower end
was shaped carefully into something like the convex
sides of two spoons put together by their bowls,
and the lower edge of this part was shaved down to
a sharpness that was increased by slightly hardening
it in the fire. Just above the thickest part of
the dibble, a hole was bored at right angles through
the wood, and into this a peg was driven so that
several inches stuck out on both sides of the instrument.
This completed the dibble.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that is a dibble, is it?&#8221; said Oscar, when
the first one was shown him. &#8220;A dibble. Now
let&#8217;s see how you use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon his Uncle Aleck stood up, grasped the
staff by the upper end, pressed his foot on the peg
at the lower end of the tool, and so forced the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
sharp point of the dibble downward into the earth.
Then, drawing it out, a convex slit was shown in
the elastic turf. Shaking an imaginary grain of
corn into the hole, he closed it with a stamp of his
heel, stepped on and repeated the motion a few
times, and then said, &#8220;That&#8217;s how they plant corn
on the sod in Kansas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Aleck, what a lot you know!&#8221; said
Oscar, with undisguised admiration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bryant, taking a pair of old
boots, cut off the legs just above the ankles, and,
fastening in the lower end of each a round bit of
wood, by means of small nails, quickly made a pair
of corn-droppers. Sandy&#8217;s belt, being passed through
the loop-strap of one of these, was fastened around
his waist. The dropper was to be filled with corn,
and, thus accoutred, he was ready for doing duty in
the newly ploughed field. When the lad expressed
his impatience for another day to come so that he
could begin corn-planting, the two elders of the
family laughed outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy, boy, you will be glad when to-morrow
night comes, so that you can rest from your labors.
You remember what I tell you!&#8221; said his father.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the two boys stepped bravely
out, next morning, in the wake of the breaking-team,
they were not in the least dismayed by the
prospect of working all day in the heavy furrows
of the plough. Bryant drove the leading yoke of
oxen, Charlie tried his &#8217;prentice hand with the
second yoke, and Howell held the plough.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;&#8216;He that by the plough would thrive,<br />
Must either hold the plough or drive,&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>commented Oscar, filling his corn-dropper and
eyeing his father&#8217;s rather awkward handling of
the ox-goad. Uncle Aleck had usually driven the
cattle, but his hand was now required in the more
difficult business of holding the plough.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Plough deep while sluggards sleep,&#8217;&#8221; replied
his father; &#8220;and if you don&#8217;t manage better with
dropping corn than I do with driving these oxen,
we shall have a short crop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many grains of corn to a hole, Uncle
Aleck? and how many bushels to the acre?&#8221;
asked Oscar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not more than five grains nor less than three
is the rule, my boy. Now then, step out lively.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the big team swept down the slope, leaving
a broad and shining furrow behind it. The two
boys followed, one about twenty feet behind the
other, and when the hindermost had come up to
the work of him who was ahead, he skipped the
planted part and went on ahead of his comrade
twenty feet, thus alternating each with the other.
They were cheerily at work when, apparently
from under the feet of the forward yoke of oxen,
a bird somewhat bigger than a robin flew up with
shrieks of alarm and went fluttering off along the
ground, tumbling in the grass as if desperately
wounded and unable to fly. Sandy made a rush
for the bird, which barely eluded his clutches once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
or twice, and drew him on and on in a fruitless
chase; for the timid creature soon recovered the
use of its wings, and soaring aloft, disappeared in
the depths of the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the deceivingest bird I ever saw,&#8221; panted
Sandy, out of breath with running, and looking
shamefacedly at the corn that he had spilled in
his haste to catch his prey. &#8220;Why, it acted just
as if its right wing was broken, and then it flew off
as sound as a nut, for all I could see.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the ploughmen met them, on the next turn
of the team, Uncle Aleck said, &#8220;Did you catch the
lapwing, you silly boy? That fellow fooled you
nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lapwing?&#8221; said Sandy, puzzled. &#8220;What&#8217;s a
lapwing?&#8221; But the ploughmen were already out
of earshot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know now,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read of
the lapwing; it is a bird so devoted to its young,
or its nest, that when it fancies either in danger,
it assumes all the distress of a wounded thing, and,
fluttering along the ground, draws the sportsman
away from the locality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right out of a book, Oscar!&#8221; cried Sandy.
&#8220;And here&#8217;s its nest, as sure as I&#8217;m alive!&#8221; So
saying, the lad stooped, and, parting the grass with
his hands, disclosed a pretty nest sunk in the
ground, holding five finely speckled eggs. The
bird, so lately playing the cripple, cried and
circled around the heads of the boys as they peered
into the home of the lapwing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s an actual settler that we must disturb,
Sandy,&#8221; said Oscar; &#8220;for the plough will
smash right through this nest on the very next turn.
Suppose we take it up and put it somewhere else,
out of harm&#8217;s way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; assented Sandy; and the two
boys, carefully extracting the nest from its place,
carried it well over into the ploughed ground,
where under the lee of a thick turf it was left in
safety. But, as might have been expected, the
parent lapwing never went near that nest again.
The fright had been too great.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world are you two boys up to
now?&#8221; shouted Uncle Aleck from the other side
of the ploughing. &#8220;Do you call that dropping
corn? Hurry and catch up with the team; you
are &#8217;way behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; cried Sandy; &#8220;I had clean forgotten
the corn-dropping. A nice pair of farmers
we are, Oscar!&#8221; and the lad, with might and
main, began to close rapidly the long gap between
him and the steadily moving ox-team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leg-weary work, isn&#8217;t it, Sandy?&#8221; said his
father, when they stopped at noon to take the
luncheon they had brought out into the field with
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;m terribly hungry,&#8221; returned the
boy, biting into a huge piece of cold corn-bread.
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t eat this if I were at home, and I
shouldn&#8217;t eat it now if I weren&#8217;t as hungry as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
bear. Say, daddy, you cannot think how tired my
leg is with the punching of that dibble into the
sod; seems as if I couldn&#8217;t hold out till sundown;
but I suppose I shall. First, I punch a hole by
jamming down the dibble with my foot, and then
I kick the hole again with the same foot, after I
have dropped in the grains of corn. These two
motions are dreadfully tiresome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his uncle, with a short laugh, &#8220;and
while I was watching you and Oscar, this forenoon,
I couldn&#8217;t help thinking that you did not
yet know how to make your muscles bear an equal
strain. Suppose you try changing legs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Changing legs?&#8221; exclaimed both boys at once.
&#8220;Why, how could we exchange legs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what Uncle Aleck means. I saw you
always used the right leg to jam down the dibble
with, and then you kicked the hole full with the
right heel. No wonder your right legs are tired.
Change hands and legs, once in a while, and use
the dibble on the left side of you,&#8221; said Charlie,
whose driving had tired him quite as thoroughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Charlie too awfully knowing for anything,
Oscar?&#8221; said Sandy, with some sarcasm.
Nevertheless, the lad got up, tried the dibble with
his left hand, and saying, &#8220;Thanks, Charlie,&#8221;
dropped down upon the fragrant sod and was
speedily asleep, for a generous nooning was
allowed the industrious lads.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XI_AN_INDIAN_TRAIL' id='CHAPTER_XI_AN_INDIAN_TRAIL'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AN INDIAN TRAIL.</h3>
</div>
<p>The next day was Sunday, and, true to their
New England training, the settlers refrained from
labor on the day of rest. Mr. Bryant took his
pocket Bible and wandered off into the wild waste
of lands somewhere. The others lounged about
the cabin, indoors and out, a trifle sore and stiff
from the effects of work so much harder than that
to which they had been accustomed, and glad of
an opportunity to rest their limbs. The younger
of the boy settlers complained that they had worn
their legs out with punching holes in the sod while
planting corn. The soles of their feet were sore
with the pressure needed to jam the dibble through
the tough turf. In the afternoon, they all wandered
off through the sweet and silent wilderness
of rolling prairie into the woods in which they
proposed to lay off another claim for pre-emption.
At a short distance above their present home, cutting
sharply through the sod, and crossing the
Republican Fork a mile or so above their own ford,
was an old Indian trail, which the boys had before
noticed but could not understand. As Charlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
and Oscar, pressing on ahead of their elders, came
upon the old trail, they loitered about until the
rest of the party came up, and then they asked
what could have cut that narrow track in the turf,
so deep and so narrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an Injun trail,&#8221; said Younkins, who,
with an uncomfortably new suit of Sunday clothes
and a smooth-shaven face, had come over to visit
his new neighbors. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever see an Injun
trail before?&#8221; he asked, noting the look of eager
curiosity on the faces of the boys. They assured
him that they never had, and he continued: &#8220;This
yere trail has been here for years and years, long
and long before any white folks came into the
country. Up north and east of yer, on the head-waters
of the Big Blue, the Cheyennes used to
live,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;Younkins pronounced it Shyans,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;and
as soon as the grass began to start in the spring,
so as to give feed to their ponies and to the buffalo,
they would come down this yere way for game.
They crossed the Fork just above yere-like, and
then they struck down to the head-waters of the
Smoky Hill and so off to the westwards. Big
game was plenty in those days, and now the Injuns
off to the north of yere come down in just the
same way&ndash;&ndash;hunting for game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys got down on their knees and scanned
the trail with new interest. It was not more than
nine or ten inches across, and was so worn down
that it made a narrow trench, as it were, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
deep sod, its lower surface being as smooth as a
rolled wagon-track. Over this well-worn track,
for ages past, the hurrying feet of wild tribes had
passed so many times that even the wiry grass-roots
had been killed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did war parties ever go out on this trail, do
you suppose?&#8221; asked Sandy, sitting up in the
grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive, yes!&#8221; replied Younkins. &#8220;Why,
the Cheyennes and the Comanches used to roam
over all these plains, in the old times, and they
were mostly at war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Cheyennes and the Comanches
now, Mr. Younkins?&#8221; asked Uncle Aleck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the Comanches are off to the south-like
somewhere. It appears to me that I heard
they were down off the Texas border, somewheres;
the Cheyennes are to the westwards, somewhere
near Fort Laramie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what Indians are there who use this trail
now?&#8221; inquired Oscar, whose eyes were sparkling
with excitement as he studied the well-worn path
of the Indian tribes.</p>
<p>Younkins explained that the Pottawottomies
and the Pawnees, now located to the north, were
the only ones who used the trail. &#8220;Blanket Indians,&#8221;
he said they were, peaceable creatures
enough, but not good neighbors; he did not want
any Indians of any sort near him. When one of the
boys asked what blanket Indians were, Younkins
explained,&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s three kinds of Injuns, none on &#8217;em
good,&ndash;&ndash;town Injuns, blanket Injuns, and wild
Injuns. You saw some of the town Injuns when
you came up through the Delaware reserve&ndash;&ndash;great
lazy fellows, lyin&#8217; round the house all day and lettin&#8217;
the squaws do all the work. Then there&#8217;s
the blankets; they live out in the woods and on
the prairie, in teepees, or lodges, of skins and
canvas-like, moving round from place to place,
hunting over the plains in summer, and living off&#8217;n
the Gov&#8217;ment in winter. They are mostly at
peace with the whites, but they will steal whenever
they get a chance. The other kind, and the
worst, is the wild ones. They have nothing to do
with the Government, and they make war on the
whites whenever they feel like it. Just now, I
don&#8217;t know of any wild Injuns that are at war
with Uncle Sam; but the Arapahoes, Comanches,
and Cheyennes are all likely to break loose any
time. I give &#8217;m all a plenty of elbow room.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boys reluctantly ceased contemplating
the fascinating Indian trail, and moved on behind
the rest of the party, Charlie said: &#8220;I suppose we
must make allowance for Younkins&#8217;s prejudices.
He is like most of the border men, who believe
that all the good Indians are dead. If the Cheyennes
and the Comanches could only tell their
story in the books and newspapers, we might hear
the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of a wild Indian&#8217;s writing a book or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
letter to the newspapers tickled Sandy so much
that he laughed loud and long.</p>
<p>Some two miles above the point where the settlers&#8217;
ford crossed the Republican Fork, the stream
swept around a bluffy promontory, and on a curve
just above this was the tract of timber land which
they now proposed to enter upon for their second
claim. The trees were oak, hickory, and beech,
with a slight undergrowth of young cottonwoods
and hazel. The land lay prettily, the stream at
this point flowing in a southerly direction, with
the timber claim on its northwesterly bank. The
sunny exposure of the grove, the open glades that
diversified its dense growth, and the babbling brook
that wound its way through it to the river, all combined
to make it very desirable for a timber claim.
At a short distance from the river the land rose
gradually to a high ridge, and on the top of this
grew a thick wood of spruce and fir.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you want for your next cabin,&#8221;
said Younkins, pointing his finger in the direction
of the pines. &#8220;Best kind of stuff for building
there is in these parts.&#8221; Then he explained to the
boys the process of cutting down the trees, splitting
them up into shakes, or into lengths suitable
for cabin-building, and he gave them an entertaining
account of all the ways and means of finishing
up a log-cabin,&ndash;&ndash;a process, by the way, which they
found then more entertaining in description than
they afterward found it in the reality.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>That night when Sandy lay down to refreshing
sleep it was to dream of picturesque Indian fights,
witnessed at a safe distance from afar. Accordingly,
he was not very much surprised next morning,
while he was helping Charlie to get ready the
breakfast, when Oscar ran in breathless, with the
one word, &#8220;Indians!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out on the hill back of the cabin,&#8221; panted
Oscar. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em coming out on the
trail we saw yesterday, all in Indian file. Hurry
up!&#8221; and away he darted, Sandy hastening with
him to see the wonderful sight.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there they were, twenty-five or
thirty Indians,&ndash;&ndash;blanket Indians, as Younkins
would have said,&ndash;&ndash;strung along in the narrow
trail, all in Indian file. It amazed the lads to see
how the little Indian ponies managed to keep their
feet in the narrow path. But they seemed to trot
leisurely along with one foot before the other, just
as the Indians did. Behind the mounted men
were men and boys on foot, nearly as many as had
passed on horseback. These kept up with the
others, silently but swiftly maintaining the same
pace that the mounted fellows did. It was a picturesque
and novel sight to the young settlers.
The Indians were dressed in the true frontier
style, with hunting-shirt and leggings of dressed
deerskin, a blanket slung loosely over the shoulder,
all bareheaded, and with coarse black hair
flowing in the morning breeze, except for the loose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
knot in which it was twisted behind. Some of
them carried their guns slung on their backs; and
others of them had the weapons in their hands,
ready for firing on the instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go, over the divide,&#8221; said Oscar, as
the little cavalcade reached the last roll of the
prairie, and began to disappear on the other side.
Not one of the party deigned even to look in the
direction of the wondering boys; and if they saw
them, as they probably did, they made no sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go, hunting buffalo, I suppose,&#8221;
said Sandy, with a sigh, as the last Indian of the
file disappeared down the horizon. &#8220;Dear me!
don&#8217;t I wish I was going out after buffalo, instead
of having to dibble corn into the sod all day!
Waugh! Don&#8217;t I hate it!&#8221; And the boy turned
disconsolately back to the cabin. But he rallied
with his natural good-humor when he had his tale
to tell at the breakfast-table. He eagerly told
how they had seen the Indians passing over the
old trail, and had gazed on the redskins as they
went &#8220;on the warpath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warpath, indeed!&#8221; laughed Charlie. &#8220;Pot-hunters,
that&#8217;s what they are. All the warfare
they are up to is waged on the poor innocent
buffalo that Younkins says they are killing off and
making scarcer every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If nobody but Indians killed buffalo,&#8221; said
Mr. Bryant, &#8220;there would be no danger of their
ever being all killed off. But, in course of time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
I suppose this country will all be settled up, and
then there will be railroads, and after that the
buffalo will have to go. Just now, any white man
that can&#8217;t saddle his horse and go out and kill a
buffalo before breakfast thinks they are getting
scarce. But I have heard some of the soldiers say
that away up north of here, a little later in the
season, the settlers cannot keep their crops, the
buffalo roam all over everything so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my part,&#8221; put in Charlie, &#8220;I am not in
the least afraid that the buffalo will be so plenty
around these parts that they will hurt our crops;
and I&#8217;d just like to see a herd come within shooting
distance.&#8221; And here he raised his arms, and
took aim along an imaginary rifle.</p>
<p>Later in the forenoon, when the two younger
boys had reached the end of the two rows in which
they had been planting, Sandy straightened himself
up with an effort, and said, &#8220;This is leg-weary
work, isn&#8217;t it, Oscar? I hate work, anyhow,&#8221; he
added, discontentedly, leaning on the top of his
dibble, and looking off over the wide and green
prairie that stretched toward the setting sun. &#8220;I
wish I was an Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar burst into a laugh, and said, &#8220;Wish you
were an Indian!&ndash;&ndash;so you could go hunting when
you like, and not have any work to do? Why,
Sandy, I didn&#8217;t think that of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy colored faintly, and said, &#8220;Well, I do
hate work, honestly; and it is only because I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
know that I ought, and that father expects me to
do my share, that I do it, and never grumble about
it. Say, I never do grumble, do I, Oscar?&#8221; he
asked earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only once in a while, when you can&#8217;t help it,
Sandy. I don&#8217;t like work any better than you do;
but it&#8217;s no use talking about it, we&#8217;ve got to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always feel so in the spring,&#8221; said Sandy,
very gravely and with a little sigh, as he went
pegging away down another furrow.</p>
<p>Forty acres of land was all that the settlers
intended to plant with corn, for the first year.
Forty acres does not seem a very large tract of
land to speak of, but when one sees the area
marked out with a black furrow, and realizes that
every foot of it must be covered with the corn-planter,
it looks formidable. The boys thought it
was a very big piece of land when they regarded
it in that way. But the days soon flew by; and
even while the young workers were stumping over
the field, they consoled themselves with visions of
gigantic ripe watermelons and mammoth pumpkins
and squashes that would regale their eyes before
long. For, following the example of most Kansas
farmers, they had stuck into many of the furrows
with the corn the seeds of these easily grown
vines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep the melons a good way from the pumpkins,
and the squashes a good way from both, if you
don&#8217;t want a bad mixture,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the boy settlers. Then he explained that if the
pollen of the squash-blossoms should happen to fall
on the melon-blossoms, the fruit would be neither
good melon nor yet good squash, but a poor mixture
of both. This piece of practical farming was
not lost on Charlie; and when he undertook the
planting of the garden spot which they found near
the cabin, he took pains to separate the cucumber-beds
as far as possible from the hills in which he
planted his cantaloupe seeds. The boys were learning
while they worked, even if they did grumble
occasionally over their tasks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>HOUSE-BUILDING.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a change in the programme of daily
labor, when the corn was in the ground. At odd
times the settlers had gone over to the wood-lot
and had laid out their plans for the future home
on that claim. There was more variety to be expected
in house-building than in planting, and the
boys had looked forward with impatience to the
beginning of that part of their enterprise. Logs
for the house were cut from the pines and firs of
the hill beyond the river bluff. From these, too,
were to be riven, or split, the &#8220;shakes&#8221; for the
roof-covering and for the odd jobs of work to be
done about the premises.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, the boys learned the use
of some of the strange tools that they had brought
with them. They had wondered over the frow, an
iron instrument about fourteen inches long, for
splitting logs. At right angles with the blade, and
fixed in an eye at one end, was a handle of hard-wood.
A section of wood was stood up endwise
on a firm foundation of some sort, and the thin end
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of the frow was hammered down into the grain of
the wood, making a lengthwise split.</p>
<p>In the same way, the section of wood so riven
was split again and again until each split was thin
enough. The final result was called a &#8220;shake.&#8221;
Shakes were used for shingles, and even&ndash;&ndash;when
nailed on frames&ndash;&ndash;for doors. Sawed lumber was
very dear; and, except the sashes in the windows,
every bit of the log-cabin must be got out of the
primitive forest.</p>
<p>The boys were proud of the ample supply which
their elders had brought with them; for even the
knowing Younkins, scrutinizing the tools for woodcraft
with a critical eye, remarked, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good
outfit, for a party of green settlers.&#8221; Six stout
wedges of chilled iron, and a heavy maul to hammer
them with, were to be used for the splitting up
of the big trees into smaller sections. Wooden
wedges met the wants of many people in those
primitive parts, at times, and the man who had a
good set of iron wedges and a powerful maul was
regarded with envy.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are these clumsy rings for?&#8221; Oscar had
asked when he saw the maul-rings taken out of the
wagon on their arrival and unloading.</p>
<p>His uncle smiled, and said, &#8220;You will find out
what these are for, my lad, when you undertake to
swing the maul. Did you never hear of splitting
rails? Well, these are to split rails and such
things from the log. We chop off a length of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
tree, about eight inches thick, taking the toughest
and densest wood we can find. Trim off the bark
from a bit of the trunk, which must be twelve or
fourteen inches long; drive your rings on each end
of the block to keep it from splitting; fit a handle
to one end, or into one side of the block; and there
you have your maul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s only a beetle, after all,&#8221; cried
Sandy, who, sitting on a stump near by, had been
a deeply interested listener to his father&#8217;s description
of the maul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my son; a maul is what people in
the Eastern States would call a beetle; but you
ask Younkins, some day, if he has a beetle over at
his place. He, I am sure, would never use the
name beetle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Log-cabin building was great fun to the boys,
although they did not find it easy work. There
was a certain novelty about the raising of the
structure that was to be a home, and an interest
in learning the use of rude tools that lasted until
the cabin was finished. The maul and the wedges,
the frow and the little maul intended for it, and
all the other means and appliances of the building,
were all new and strange to these bright lads.</p>

<span class='smcap'>Making &#8220;Shakes&#8221; with a &#8220;Frow.&#8221;</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>First, the size of the cabin, twelve feet wide
and twenty feet long, was marked out on the site
on which it was to rise, and four logs were laid
to define the foundation. These were the sills of
the new house. At each end of every log two
notches were cut, one on the under side and one
on the upper, to fit into similar notches cut in the
log below, and in that which was to be placed
on top. So each corner was formed by these interlacing
and overlapping ends. The logs were
piled up, one above another, just as children build
&#8220;cob-houses,&#8221; from odds and ends of playthings.
Cabin-builders do not say that a cabin is a certain
number of feet high; they usually say that it is
ten logs high, or twelve logs high, as the case may
be. When the structure is as high as the eaves
are intended to be, the top logs are bound together,
from side to side, with smaller logs fitted upon the
upper logs of each side and laid across as if they
were to be the supports of a floor for another story.
Then the gable-ends are built up of logs, shorter
and shorter as the peak of the gable is approached,
and kept in place by other small logs laid across,
endwise of the cabin, and locked into the end of
each log in the gable until all are in place. On
these transverse logs, or rafters, the roof is laid.
Holes are cut or sawed through the logs for the
door and windows, and the house begins to look
habitable.</p>
<p>The settlers on the Republican Fork cut the
holes for doors and windows before they put on
the roof, and when the layer of split shakes that
made the roof was in place, and the boys bounded
inside to see how things looked, they were greatly
amused to notice how light it was. The spaces
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
between the logs were almost wide enough to crawl
through, Oscar said. But they had studied log-cabin
building enough to know that these wide
cracks were to be &#8220;chinked&#8221; with thin strips of
wood, the refuse of shakes, driven in tightly, and
then daubed over with clay, a fine bed of which
was fortunately near at hand. The provident
Younkins had laid away in his own cabin the
sashes and glass for two small windows; and these
he had agreed to sell to the newcomers. Partly
hewn logs for floor-joists were placed upon the
ground inside the cabin, previously levelled off
for the purpose. On these were laid thick slabs
of oak and hickory, riven out of logs drawn from
the grove near by. These slabs of hard-wood were
&#8220;puncheons,&#8221; and fortunate as was the man who
could have a floor of sawed lumber to his cabin,
he who was obliged to use puncheons was better
off than those with whom timber was so scarce
that the natural surface on the ground was their
only floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! how it rattles!&#8221; was Sandy&#8217;s remark when
he had first taken a few steps on the new puncheon
floor of their cabin. &#8220;It sounds like a tread-mill
going its rounds. Can&#8217;t you nail these down,
daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>His father explained that the unseasoned lumber
of the puncheons would so shrink in the drying
that no fastening could hold them. They must
lie loosely on the floor-joists until they were thoroughly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
seasoned; then they might be fastened
down with wooden pins driven through holes bored
for that purpose; nails and spikes cost too much
to be wasted on a puncheon floor. In fact, very
little hardware was wasted on any part of that
cabin. Even the door was made by fastening with
wooden pegs a number of short pieces of shakes to
a frame fitted to the doorway cut in the side of
the cabin. The hinges were strong bits of leather,
the soles of the boots whose legs had been used
for corn-droppers. The clumsy wooden latch was
hung inside to a wooden pin driven into one of the
crosspieces of the door, and it played in a loop of
deerskin at the other end. A string of deerskin
fastened to the end of the latch-bar nearest the
jamb of the doorway was passed outside through
a hole cut in the door, serving to lift the latch
from without when a visitor would enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our latch-string hangs out!&#8221; exclaimed Charlie,
triumphantly, when this piece of work was
done. &#8220;I must say I never knew before what it
meant to have the &#8216;latch-string hanging out&#8217; for
all comers. See, Oscar, when we shut up the
house for the night, all we have to do is to pull in
the latch-string, and the door is barred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likewise, when you have dropped your jackknife
through a crack in the floor into the cellar
beneath, all you have to do is to turn over a puncheon
or two and get down and find it,&#8221; said Sandy,
coolly, as he took up two slabs and hunted for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
his knife. The boys soon found that although
their home was rude and not very elegant as to
its furniture, it had many conveniences that more
elaborate and handsomer houses did not have.
There were no floors to wash, hardly to sweep.
As their surroundings were simple, their wants
were few. It was a free and easy life that they
were gradually drifting into, here in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Charlie declared that the cabin ought to have
a name. As yet, the land on which they had
settled had no name except that of the river by
which it lay. The boys thought it would give
some sort of distinction to their home if they
gave it a title. &#8220;Liberty Hall,&#8221; they thought
would be a good name to put on the roof of their
log-cabin. Something out of Cooper&#8217;s novels, Oscar
proposed, would be the best for the locality.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hog-and-hominy,&#8217; how would that suit?&#8221;
asked Sandy, with a laugh. &#8220;Unless we get some
buffalo or antelope meat pretty soon, it will be hog
and hominy to the end of the chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not call it the John G. Whittier cabin?&#8221;
said Uncle Aleck, looking up from his work of
shaping an ox-yoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing, daddy!&#8221; shouted Sandy, clapping
his hands. &#8220;Only don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s
a very long name to say in a hurry? Whittier
would be shorter, you know. But, then,&#8221; he
added, doubtfully, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t everybody that would
know which Whittier was meant by that, would
they?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy seems to think that the entire population
of Kansas will be coming here, some day,
to read that name, if we ever have it. We have
been here two months now, and no living soul but
ourselves and Younkins has ever been in these
diggings; not one. Oh, I say, let&#8217;s put up just
nothing but &#8216;Whittier&#8217; over the door there.
We&#8217;ll know what that means, and if anybody
comes in the course of time, I&#8217;ll warrant he&#8217;ll
soon find out which Whittier it means.&#8221; This
was Oscar&#8217;s view of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Oscar!&#8221; said his uncle. &#8220;Whittier
let it be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before sundown, that day, a straight-grained
shake of pine, free from knot or blemish, had been
well smoothed down with the draw-shave, and on
its fair surface, writ large, was the beloved name
of the New England poet, thus: WHITTIER.</p>
<p>This was fastened securely over the entrance of
the new log-cabin, and the Boy Settlers, satisfied
with their work, stood off at a little distance and
gave it three cheers. The new home was named.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>LOST!</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We must have some board-nails and some
lead,&#8221; remarked Uncle Aleck, one fine morning,
as the party were putting the finishing touches to
the Whittier cabin. &#8220;Who will go down to the
post and get them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8221;, shouted all three of the boys at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you will all go, will you?&#8221; said he, with
a smile. &#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t all go, for we can borrow
only one horse, and it&#8217;s ten miles down there
and ten miles back; and you will none of you care
to walk, I am very sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other and laughed.
Who should be the lucky one to take that delightful
horseback ride down to the post, as Fort Riley
was called, and get a glimpse of civilization?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Sandy, after
some good-natured discussion. &#8220;Let&#8217;s draw cuts
to see who shall go. Here they are. You draw
first, Charlie, you being the eldest man. Now,
then, Oscar. Why, hooray! it&#8217;s my cut! I&#8217;ve
drawn the longest, and so I am to go. Oh, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
a fair and square deal, daddy,&#8221; he added, seeing
his father look sharply at him.</p>
<p>The matter was settled, and next morning,
bright and early, Sandy was fitted out with his
commissions and the money to buy them with.
Younkins had agreed to let him have his horse,
saddle, and bridle. Work on the farm was now
practically over until time for harvesting was
come. So the other two boys accompanied Sandy
over to the Younkins side of the river and saw
him safely off down the river road leading to the
post. A meal-sack in which to bring back his
few purchases was snugly rolled up and tied to
the crupper of his saddle, and feeling in his
pocket for the hundredth time to make sure of
the ten-dollar gold piece therein bestowed, Sandy
trotted gayly down the road. The two other
boys gazed enviously after him, and then went
home, wondering, as they strolled along, how long
Sandy would be away. He would be back by
dark at the latest, for the days were now at about
their longest, and the long summer day was just
begun.</p>
<p>At Younkins&#8217;s cabin they met Hiram Battles, a
neighbor who lived beyond the divide to the eastward,
and who had just ridden over in search of
some of his cattle that had strayed away, during
the night before. Mr. Battles said he was &#8220;powerful
worrited.&#8221; Indians had been seen prowling
around on his side of the divide: but he had seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
no signs of a camp, and he had traced the tracks
of his cattle, three head in all, over this way as far
as Lone Tree Creek, a small stream just this side
of the divide; but there he had unaccountably lost
all trace of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as for the Indians,&#8221; said Charlie, modestly,
&#8220;we have seen them passing out on the trail.
But they were going hunting, and they kept right
on to the southward and westward; and we have
not seen them go back since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Younkins, slowly, &#8220;but
still I don&#8217;t like the stories I hear down the road a
piece. They do say that the Shians have riz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cheyennes have risen!&#8221; exclaimed Charlie.
&#8220;And we have let Sandy go down to the post
alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of the men laughed&ndash;&ndash;a little unpleasantly,
it seemed to the boys, although Younkins was the
soul of amiability and mildness. But Charlie
thought it was unkind in them to laugh at his
very natural apprehensions; and he said as much,
as he and Oscar, with their clothes on their heads,
waded the Republican Fork on the way home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Charlie,&#8221; was Oscar&#8217;s comforting remark,
as they scrambled up the opposite bank, &#8220;I guess
the reason why they laughed at us was that if the
Cheyennes have gone on the warpath, the danger
is out in the west; whereas, Sandy has gone eastward
to-day, and that is right in the way of safety,
isn&#8217;t it? He&#8217;s gone to the post; and you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
that the people down at Soldier Creek told us that
this was a good place to settle, because the post
would be our protection in case of an Indian
rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sandy was blissfully and peacefully
jogging along in the direction of the military post.
Only one house stood between Younkins&#8217;s and the
fort; and that was Mullett&#8217;s. They all had occasion
to think pleasantly of Mullett&#8217;s; for whenever
an opportunity came for the mail to be forwarded
from the fort up to Mullett&#8217;s, it was sent there;
then Sparkins, who was the next neighbor above,
but who lived off the road a bit, would go down
to Mullett&#8217;s and bring the mail up to his cabin;
when he did this, he left a red flannel flag flying
on the roof of his house, and Younkins, if passing
along the trail, saw the signal and went out of his
way a little to take the mail up to his cabin.
Somehow, word was sent across the river to the
Whittier boys, as the good Younkins soon learned
to call the Boy Settlers, and they went gladly
over to Younkins&#8217;s and got the precious letters
and papers from home. That was the primitive
way in which the mail for the settlers on the
Republican Fork went up the road from Fort
Riley, in those days; and all letters and papers
designed for the settlers along there were addressed
simply to Fort Riley, which was their
nearest post-office.</p>
<p>So Sandy, when he reached Mullett&#8217;s, was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
disappointed to be told that there were no letters
for anybody up the river. There had been nobody
down to the post very lately. Sandy knew that,
and he was confident that he would have the
pleasure of bringing up a good-sized budget when
he returned. So he whipped up his somewhat
lazy steed and cantered down toward the fort.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving Mullett&#8217;s he met a drove of
sheep. The drivers were two men and a boy of
his own age, mounted on horseback and carrying
their provisions, apparently, strapped behind them.
When he asked them where they were going, they
surlily replied that they were going to California.
That would take them right up the road that he
had come down, Sandy thought to himself. And
he wondered if the boys at home would see the
interesting sight of five hundred sheep going up
the Republican Fork, bound for California.</p>
<p>He reached the fort before noon; and, with a
heart beating high with pleasure, he rode into the
grounds and made his way to the well-remembered
sutler&#8217;s store where he had bought the candy,
months before. He had a few pennies of his own,
and he mentally resolved to spend these for raisins.
Sandy had a &#8220;sweet tooth&#8221;, but, except for sugar
and molasses, he had eaten nothing sweet since
they were last at Fort Riley on their way westward.</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of considerable importance
that Sandy surveyed the interior of the sutler&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
store. The proprietor looked curiously at him, as
if wondering why so small a boy should turn up
alone in that wilderness; and when the lad asked
for letters for the families up the river, Mullett&#8217;s,
Sparkins&#8217;s, Battles&#8217;s, Younkins&#8217;s, and his own
people, the sutler said: &#8220;Be you one of them
Abolitioners that have named your place after
that man Whittier, the Abolition poet? I&#8217;ve
hearn tell of you, and I&#8217;ve hearn tell of him.
And he ain&#8217;t no good. Do you hear me?&#8221; Sandy
replied that he heard him, and to himself he wondered
greatly how anybody, away down here, ten
miles from the new home, could possibly have
heard about the name they had given to their
cabin.</p>
<p>Several soldiers who had been lounging around
the place now went out at the door. The sutler,
looking cautiously about as if to be sure that
nobody heard him, said: &#8220;Never you mind what
I said just now, sonny. Right you are, and that
man Whittier writes the right sort of stuff. Bet
yer life! I&#8217;m no Abolitioner; but I&#8217;m a free-State
man, I am, every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what made you talk like that, just
now?&#8221; asked Sandy, his honest, freckled face
glowing with righteous indignation. &#8220;If you like
Mr. John G. Whittier&#8217;s poetry, why did you say
he wasn&#8217;t any good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Policy, policy, my little man. This yere&#8217;s a
pro-slavery guv&#8217;ment, and this yere is a pro-slavery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
post. I couldn&#8217;t keep this place one single
day if they thought I was a free-State man. See?
But I tell you right here, and don&#8217;t you fergit it,
this yere country is going to be free State. Kansas
is no good for slavery; and slavery can&#8217;t get
in here. Stick a pin there, and keep your eye
on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some wonder and much disgust at the
man&#8217;s cowardice, Sandy packed his precious letters
in the bosom of his shirt. Into one end of his
meal-sack he put a pound of soda-biscuit for which
his Uncle Charlie had longed, a half-pound of
ground ginger with which Charlie desired to make
some &#8220;molasses gingerbread, like mother&#8217;s,&#8221; and
a half-pound of smoking-tobacco for his dear
father. It seemed a long way off to his father
now, Sandy thought, as he tied up that end of the
bag. Then into the other end, having tied the
bag firmly around, about a foot and a half from
the mouth, he put the package of nails and a roll
of sheet lead. It had been agreed that if they
were to go buffalo-hunting, they must have rifle-balls
and bullets for their shot-guns.</p>
<p>The sutler, who had become very friendly,
looked on with an amused smile, and said, &#8220;&#8217;Pears
to me, sonny, you got all the weight at one end,
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy did not like to be called &#8220;sonny,&#8221; but he
good-naturedly agreed that he had made a mistake;
so he began all over again and shifted his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
cargo so that the nails and a box of yeast-powder
occupied one end of the meal-sack, and the other
articles balanced the other. The load was then
tied closely to the crupper of the saddle and the
boy was ready to start on his homeward trip. His
eyes roved longingly over the stock of goodies
which the sutler kept for the children, young and
old, of the garrison, and he asked, &#8220;How much
for raisins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two bits a pound for box, and fifteen cents for
cask,&#8221; replied the man, sententiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me half a pound of cask raisins,&#8221; said
the boy, with some hesitation. He had only a few
cents to spare for his own purchases.</p>
<p>The sutler weighed out a half-pound of box
raisins, did them up, and handed them across the
counter, saying, &#8220;No pay; them&#8217;s for Whittier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy took the package, shoved it into his
shirt-bosom, and, wondering if his &#8220;Thank you&#8221;
were sufficient payment for the gift, mounted his
steed, rode slowly up the road to a spring that he
had noticed bubbling out of the side of a ravine,
and with a thankful heart, turning out the horse
to graze, sat down to eat his frugal lunch, now
graced with the dry but to him delicious raisins.
So the sutler at Fort Riley was a free-State man!
Wasn&#8217;t that funny!</p>
<p>It was a beautifully bright afternoon, and
Sandy, gathering his belongings together, started
up the river road on a brisk canter. The old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
horse was a hard trotter, and when he slackened
down from a canter, poor Sandy shook in every
muscle, and his teeth chattered as if he had a fit
of ague. But whenever the lad contrived to
urge his steed into an easier gait he got on
famously. The scenery along the Republican Fork
is (or was) very agreeable to the eye. Long
slopes of vivid green stretched off in every direction,
their rolling sides dropping into deep ravines
through which creeks, bordered with dense growths
of alder, birch, and young cottonwood, meandered.
The sky was blue and cloudless, and, as the boy
sped along the breezy uplands, the soft and balmy
air fanning his face, he sung and whistled to express
the fervor of his buoyant spirits. He was a
hearty and a happy boy.</p>
<p>Suddenly he came to a fork in the road which
he had not noticed when he came down that way
in the morning. For a moment he was puzzled
by the sight. Both were broad and smooth tracks
over the grassy prairie, and both rose and fell over
the rolling ground; only, one led to the left and
somewhat southerly, and the other to the right.
&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; muttered Sandy, and he paused and
rubbed his head for an idea. &#8220;That left-hand
road must strike off to some ford lower down on
the Fork than I have ever been. But I never
heard of any ford below ours.&#8221;</p>
<div class='figtag'>

<span class='smcap'>Filling in the Chinks in the Walls of the Log-cabin.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>With that, his keen eyes noticed that the right-hand
road was cut and marked with the many
hoof-tracks of a flock of sheep. He argued to
himself that the sheep-drivers had told him that
they were going to California. The California
road led up the bank of the Republican Fork close
to the trail that led him from Younkins&#8217;s to the
ford across the river. The way was plain; so,
striking his spur into the old sorrel&#8217;s side, he
dashed on up the right-hand road, singing gayly as
he went.</p>
<p>Absorbed in the mental calculation as to the
number of days that it would take that flock of
sheep to reach California, the boy rode on, hardly
noticing the landmarks by the way, or taking in
anything but the general beauty of the broad and
smiling landscape over which the yellow light of
the afternoon sun, sinking in the west, poured a
flood of splendor. Slackening his speed as he
passed a low and sunken little round valley filled
with brush and alders, he heard a queer sound
like the playful squealing of some wild animal.
Slipping off his saddle and leading his horse by
the bridle over the thick turf, Sandy cautiously
approached the edge of the valley, the margin of
which was steep and well sheltered by a growth
of cottonwoods. After peering about for some
time, the lad caught a glimpse of a beautiful sight.
A young doe and her fawn were playing together
in the open meadow below, absolutely unconscious
of the nearness of any living thing besides themselves.
The mother-deer was browsing, now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
again, and at times the fawn, playful as a young
kitten, would kick its heels, or butt its head
against its mother&#8217;s side, and both would squeal
in a comical way.</p>
<p>Sandy had never seen deer in a state of living
wildness before, and his heart thumped heavily in
his breast as he gazed on the wonderful sight. He
half groaned to himself that he was a great fool
to have come away from home without a gun.
What an easy shot it was! How nicely he could
knock over the mother, if only he had a shot-gun!
She was within such short range. Then he felt a
sinking of the heart, as he imagined the horror of
death that would have overtaken the innocent and
harmless creatures, sporting there so thoughtless
of man&#8217;s hunting instincts and cruelty. Would
he kill them, if he had the weapon to kill with?
He could not make up his mind that he would.
So he crouched silently in the underbrush, and
watched the pretty sight as if it were a little animal
drama enacted here in the wilderness, mother and
child having a romp in their wildwood home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give them a good scare, anyhow,&#8221;
muttered the boy, his sportive instincts getting
the better of his tender-heartedness at last. He
dashed up noisily from the underbrush, swung his
arms, and shouted, &#8220;Boo!&#8221; Instantly deer and
fawn, with two or three tremendous bounds, were
out of the little valley and far away on the prairie,
skimming over the rolls of green, and before the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
boy could catch his breath, they had disappeared
into one of the many dells and ravines that interlaced
the landscape.</p>
<p>But another animal was scared by the boy&#8217;s
shout. In his excitement he had slipped the bridle-rein
from his arm, and the old sorrel, terrified
by his halloo, set off on a brisk trot down the road.
In vain Sandy called to him to stop. Free from
guidance, the horse trotted along, and when, after
a long chase, Sandy caught up with his steed, a
considerable piece of road had been covered the
wrong way, for the horse had gone back over
the line of march. When Sandy was once more
mounted, and had mopped his perspiring forehead,
he cast his eye along the road, and, to his dismay,
discovered that the sheep-tracks had disappeared.
What had become of the sheep? How could they
have left the trail without his sooner noticing it?
He certainly had not passed another fork of the
road since coming into this at the fork below.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more of my heedlessness, mother would
say,&#8221; muttered Sandy to himself. &#8220;What a big
fool I must have been to miss seeing where the
sheep left the trail! I shall never make a good
plainsman if I don&#8217;t keep my eye skinned better
than this. Jingo! it&#8217;s getting toward sundown!&#8221;
Sure enough, the sun was near the horizon, and
Sandy could see none of the familiar signs of the
country round about the Fork.</p>
<p>But he pushed on. It was too late now to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
return to the fork of the road and explore the other
branch. He was in for it. He remembered,
too, that two of their most distant neighbors, Mr.
Fuller and his wife, lived somewhere back of
Battles&#8217;s place, and it was barely possible that it
was on the creek, whose woody and crooked line
he could now see far to the westward, that their
log-cabin was situated. He had seen Mr. Fuller
over at the Fork once or twice, and he remembered
him as a gentle-mannered and kindly man. Surely
he must live on this creek! So he pushed on with
new courage, for his heart had begun to sink when
he finally realized that he was far off his road.</p>
<p>The sun was down when he reached the creek.
No sign of human habitation was in sight. In
those days cabins and settlements were very, very
few and far between, and a traveller once off his
trail might push on for hundreds of miles without
finding any trace of human life.</p>
<p>In the gathering dusk the heavy-hearted boy
rode along the banks of the creek, anxiously looking
out for some sign of settlers. It was as lonely
and solitary as if no man had ever seen its savageness
before. Now and then a night-bird called
from a thicket, as if asking what interloper came
into these solitudes; or a scared jack-rabbit scampered
away from his feeding-ground, as the steps of
the horse tore through the underbrush. Even the
old sorrel seemed to gaze reproachfully at the lad,
who had dismounted, and now led the animal
through the wild and tangled undergrowths.</p>
<div class='figtag'>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>When he had gone up and down the creek several
times, hunting for some trace of a settlement,
and finding none, he reflected that Fuller&#8217;s house
was on the side of the stream, to the west. It was
a very crooked stream, and he was not sure, in
the darkness, which was west and which was east.
But he boldly plunged into the creek, mounting
his horse, and urging the unwilling beast across.
Once over, he explored that side of the stream,
hither and yon, in vain. Again he crossed, and
so many times did he cross and recross that he
finally had no idea where he was. Then the conviction
came fully into his mind: He was lost.</p>
<p>The disconsolate boy sat down on a fallen tree
and meditated. It was useless to go farther. He
was tired in every limb and very, very hungry.
He bethought himself of the soda-biscuits in his
sack. He need not starve, at any rate. Dobbin
was grazing contentedly while the lad meditated,
so slipping off the saddle and the package attached
to it, Sandy prepared to satisfy his hunger with
what little provisions he had at hand. How
queerly the biscuits tasted! Jolting up and down
on the horse&#8217;s back, they were well broken up.
But what was this so hot in the mouth? Ginger?
Sure enough, it was ginger. The pounding that
had crushed the biscuits had broken open the
package of ginger, and that spicy stuff was plentifully
sprinkled all over the contents of the sack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gingerbread,&#8221; muttered Sandy, grimly, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
blew out of his mouth some of the powdery spice.
&#8220;Faugh! Tobacco!&#8221; he cried next. His father&#8217;s
package of smoking-tobacco had shared the fate
of the ginger. Sandy&#8217;s supper was spoiled; and
resigning himself to spending the night hungry in
the wilderness, he tethered the horse to a tree, put
the saddle-blanket on the ground, arranged the
saddle for a pillow, and, having cut a few leafy
boughs from the alders, stuck them into the turf
so as to form a shelter around his head, and lay
down to pleasant dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is Saturday night, too,&#8221; thought the
lost boy. &#8220;They are having beans baked in the
ground-oven at home in the cabin. They are wondering
where I am. What would mother say if
she knew I was lost out here on Flyaway Creek?&#8221;
And the boy&#8217;s heart swelled a little, and a few
drops of water stood in his eyes, for he had never
been lost before in his life. He looked up at the
leaden sky, now overcast, and wondered if God
saw this lost boy. A few drops fell on his cheek.
Tears? No; worse than that; it was rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a little too much,&#8221; said Sandy,
stoutly. &#8220;Here goes for one more trial.&#8221; So saying,
he saddled and mounted his patient steed,
and, at a venture, took a new direction around a
bend in the creek. As he rounded the bend, the
bark of a dog suddenly rung from a mass of gloom
and darkness. How sweet the sound! Regardless
of the animal&#8217;s angry challenge, he pressed on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
That mass of blackness was a log-barn, and near
by was a corral with cows therein. Then a light
shone from the log-cabin, and a man&#8217;s voice was
heard calling the dog.</p>
<p>Fuller&#8217;s!</p>
<p>The good man of the house received the lad
with open arms, and cared for his horse; inside
the cabin, Mrs. Fuller, who had heard the conversation
without, had made ready a great pan of milk
and a loaf of bread, having risen from her bed to
care for the young wanderer. Never did bread
and milk taste so deliciously to weary traveller as
this! Full-fed, Sandy looked at the clock on the
wall, and marked with wondering eye that it was
past midnight. He had recounted his trials as he
ate, and the sympathizing couple had assured him
that he had been deceived by the sheep-driver. It
was very unlikely that he was driving his flock to
California. And it was probable that, coming to
some place affording food and water, the sheep had
left the main road and had camped down in one of
the ravines out of sight.</p>
<p>As Sandy composed his weary limbs in a blanket-lined
bunk opposite that occupied by Fuller and
his wife, he was conscious that he gave a long,
long sigh as if in his sleep. And, as he drifted off
into slumber-land, he heard the good woman say,
&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s out of his troubles, poor boy!&#8221; Sandy
chuckled to himself and slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>MORE HOUSE-BUILDING.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was an anxious and wondering household
that Sandy burst in upon next morning, when he
had reached the cabin, escorted to the divide above
Younkins&#8217;s place by his kind-hearted host of the
night before. It was Sunday morning, bright and
beautiful; but truly, never had any home looked
so pleasant to his eyes as did the homely and
weather-beaten log-cabin which they called their
own while they lived in it. He had left his borrowed
horse with its owner, and, shouldering his
meal-sack, with its dearly bought contents, he had
taken a short-cut to the cabin, avoiding the usual
trail in order that as he approached he might not
be seen from the window looking down the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sandy&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he heard his brother
Charlie say. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stake my life that he will come
home with flying colors, if you only give him time.
He&#8217;s lost the trail somehow, and had to put up
at some cabin all night. Don&#8217;t you worry about
Sandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But these Indian stories; I don&#8217;t like them,&#8221;
said his father, with a tinge of sadness in his voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Sandy could bear no more; so, flinging down
his burden, he bounced into the cabin with, &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m all right! Safe and sound, but as hungry as
a bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little party rushed to embrace the young
adventurer, and, in their first flush of surprise,
nobody remembered to be severe with him for his
carelessness. Quite the hero of the hour, the lad
sat on the table and told them his tale, how he had
lost his way, and how hospitably and well he had
been cared for at Fuller&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuller&#8217;s!&#8221; exclaimed his uncle. &#8220;What in
the world took you so far off your track as
Fuller&#8217;s? You must have gone at least ten miles
out of your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Charlie,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;it&#8217;s just as
easy to travel ten miles out of the way as it is to
go one. All you have to do is to get your face in
the wrong way, and all the rest is easy. Just keep
a-going; that&#8217;s what I did. I turned to the right
instead of to the left, and for once I found that
the right was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>A burst of laughter from Oscar, who had been
opening the sack that held Sandy&#8217;s purchases, interrupted
the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just see what a hodgepodge of a mess Sandy
has brought home! Tobacco, biscuits, ginger, and
I don&#8217;t know what not, all in a pudding. It only
lacks milk and eggs to make it a cracker pudding
flavored with ginger and smoking-tobacco!&#8221; And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
everybody joined in the laugh that a glance at
Sandy&#8217;s load called forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the blushing boy; &#8220;I forgot to tie
the bag at both ends, and the jouncing up and
down of Younkins&#8217;s old horse (dear me! wasn&#8217;t he
a hard trotter!) must have made a mash of everything
in the bag. The paper of tobacco burst, and
then I suppose the ginger followed; the jolting of
poor old &#8216;Dobbin&#8217; did the rest. Ruined, daddy?
Nothing worth saving?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Howell ruefully acknowledged that the
mixture was not good to eat, nor yet to smoke,
and certainly not to make gingerbread of. So,
after picking out some of the larger pieces of the
biscuits, the rest was thrown away, greatly to
Sandy&#8217;s mortification.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of my journey gone for nothing,&#8221; he said,
with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, my boy,&#8221; said his father, fondly;
&#8220;since you have come back alive and well, let the
rest of the business care for itself. As long as you
are alive, and the redskins have not captured you,
I am satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such was Sandy&#8217;s welcome home.</p>
<p>With the following Monday morning came hard
work,&ndash;&ndash;harder work, so Sandy thought, than miserably
trying to find one&#8217;s way in the darkness of
a strange region of country. For another log-house,
this time on the prairie claim, was to be
begun at once. They might be called on at any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
time to give up the cabin in which they were
simply tenants at will, and it was necessary that
a house of some sort be put on the claim that they
had staked out and planted. The corn was up and
doing well. Sun and rain had contributed to
hasten on the corn-field, and the vines of the
melons were vigorously pushing their way up and
down the hills of grain. Charlie wondered what
they would do with so many watermelons when
they ripened; there would be hundreds of them;
and the mouths that were to eat them, although
now watering for the delicious fruit, were not
numerous enough to make away with a hundredth
part of what would be ripe very soon. There was
no market nearer than the post, and there were
many melon-patches between Whittier&#8217;s and the
fort.</p>
<p>But the new log-house, taken hold of with
energy, was soon built up to the height where the
roof was to be put on. At this juncture, Younkins
advised them to roof over the cabin slightly, make
a corn-bin of it, and wait for developments. For,
he argued, if there should be any rush of emigrants
and settlers to that part of the country, so that
their claims were in danger of dispute, they would
have ample warning, and could make ready for an
immediate occupation of the place. If nobody
came, then the corn-house, or bin, would be all
they wanted of the structure.</p>
<p>But Mr. Howell, who took the lead in all such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
matters, shook his head doubtfully. He was not
in favor of evading the land laws; he was more
afraid of the claim being jumped. If they were to
come home from a hunting trip, some time, and
find their log-cabin occupied by a &#8220;claim-jumper,&#8221;
or &#8220;squatter,&#8221; as these interlopers are called, and
their farm in the possession of strangers, wouldn&#8217;t
they feel cheap? He thought so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Uncle Aleck,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;why not finish
it off as a cabin to live in, put in the corn when it
ripens, and then we shall have the concern as a
dwelling, in case there is any danger of the claim
being jumped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great head, Oscar,&#8221; said his uncle, admiringly.
&#8220;That is the best notion yet. We will complete
the cabin just as if we were to move into it, and if
anybody who looks like an intended claim-jumper
comes prowling around, we will take the alarm and
move in. But so far, I&#8217;m sure, there&#8217;s been no
rush to these parts. It&#8217;s past planting season, and
it is not likely that anybody will get up this way,
now so far west, without our knowing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the log-cabin, or, as they called it, &#8220;Whittier,
Number Two,&#8221; was finished with all that the land
laws required, with a window filled with panes of
glass, a door, and a &#8220;stick chimney&#8221; built of sticks
plastered with clay, a floor and space enough on
the ground to take care of a family twice as large
as theirs, in case of need. When all was done,
they felt that they were now able to hold their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
farming claim as well as their timber claim, for on
each was a goodly log-house, fit to live in and comfortable
for the coming winter if they should make
up their minds to live in the two cabins during
that trying season.</p>
<p>The boys took great satisfaction in their kitchen-garden
near the house in which they were tenants;
for when Younkins lived there, he had
ploughed and spaded the patch, and planted it two
seasons, so now it was an old piece of ground compared
with the wild land that had just been broken
up around it. In their garden-spot they had planted
a variety of vegetables for the table, and in the
glorious Kansas sunshine, watered by frequent
showers, they were thriving wonderfully. They
promised themselves much pleasure and profit from
a garden that they would make by their new cabin,
when another summer should come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Younkins says that he can walk all over his
melon-patch on the other side of the Fork, stepping
only on the melons and never touching the ground
once,&#8221; said Oscar, one day, later in the season, as
they were feasting themselves on one of the delicious
watermelons that now so plentifully dotted
their own corn-field.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a big story!&#8221; exclaimed both of the
other boys at once. But Oscar appealed to his
father, who came striding by the edge of the field
where they chatted together. Had he ever heard
of such a thing?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant, good-naturedly, &#8220;I
have heard of melons so thick in a patch, and
so big around, that the sunshine couldn&#8217;t get to
the ground except at high noon. How is that for
a tall story?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys protested that that was only a tale of
fancy. Could it be possible that anybody could
raise melons so thickly together as Mr. Younkins
had said he had seen them? Mr. Bryant, having
kicked open a fine melon, took out the heart of it
to refresh himself with, as was the manner of the
settlers, where the fruit was so plenty and the
market so far out of reach; then, between long
drafts of the delicious pulp, he explained that certain
things, melons for example, flourished better
on the virgin soil of the sod than elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another year or so,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you will
never see on this patch of land such melons as
these. They will never do so well again on this
soil as this year. I never saw such big melons as
these, and if we had planted them a little nearer
together, I don&#8217;t in the least doubt that any smart
boy, like Sandy here, could walk all over the field
stepping from one melon to another, if he only had
a pole to balance himself with as he walked. There
would be nothing very &#8216;wonderful-like&#8217; about that.
It&#8217;s a pity that we have no use for these, there are
so many of them and they are so good. Pity some
of the folks at home haven&#8217;t a few of them&ndash;&ndash;a
hundred or two, for instance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>It did seem a great waste of good things that
these hundreds and hundreds of great watermelons
should decay on the ground for lack of somebody
to eat them. In the very wantonness of their
plenty the settlers had been accustomed to break
open two or three of the finest of the fruit before
they could satisfy themselves that they had got
one of the best. Even then they only took the
choicest parts, leaving the rest to the birds. By
night, too, the coyotes, or prairie-wolves, mean
and sneaking things that they were, would steal
down into the melon-patch, and, in the desperation
of their hunger, nose into the broken melons left
by the settlers, and attempt to drag away some of
the fragments, all the time uttering their fiendish
yelps and howls.</p>
<p>Somebody had told the boys that the juice of
watermelons boiled to a thick syrup was a very
good substitute for molasses. Younkins told them
that, back in old Missouri, &#8220;many families never
had any other kind of sweetenin&#8217; in the house than
watermelon molasses.&#8221; So Charlie made an experiment
with the juice boiled until it was pretty
thick. All hands tasted it, and all hands voted
that it was very poor stuff. They decided that
they could not make their superabundance of
watermelons useful except as an occasional refreshment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>PLAY COMES AFTER WORK.</h3>
</div>
<p>The two cabins built, wood for the winter cut
and hauled, and the planting all done, there was
now nothing left to do but to wait and see the
crop ripen. Their good friend Younkins was in
the same fortunate condition, and he was ready to
suggest, to the intense delight of the boys, that
they might be able to run into a herd of buffalo, if
they should take a notion to follow the old Indian
trail out to the feeding-grounds. In those days
there was no hunting west of the new settlement,
except that by the Indians. In that vague and
mysterious way by which reports travel&ndash;&ndash;in the
air, as it were&ndash;&ndash;among all frontier settlements,
they had heard that buffalo were plenty in the
vast ranges to the westward, the herds moving
slowly northward, grazing as they went. It was
now the season of wild game, and so the boys
were sent across to Younkins&#8217;s to ask him what he
thought of a buffalo-hunting trip.</p>
<p>Reaching his cabin, the good woman of the house
told them that he had gone into the tall timber
near by, thinking he heard some sort of wild birds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
in the underbrush. He had taken his gun with
him; in fact, Younkins was seldom seen without
his gun, except when he was at work in the fields.
The boys gleefully followed Younkins&#8217;s trail into
the forest, making for an opening about a half-mile
away, where Mrs. Younkins thought he was most
likely to be found. &#8220;Major,&#8221; the big yellow dog, a
special pet of Sandy&#8217;s, accompanied them, although
his mistress vainly tried to coax him back. Major
was fond of boys&#8217; society.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Younkins now!&#8221; cried Oscar, as they
drew near an opening in the wood into which the
hot sunlight poured. Younkins was half crouching
and cautiously making his way into the nearer
side of the opening, and the boys, knowing that
he was on the track of game, silently drew near,
afraid of disturbing the hunter or the hunted. Suddenly
Major, catching sight of the game, bounded
forward with a loud bark into the tangle of berry
bushes and vines. There was a confused noise of
wings, a whistle of alarm which also sounded like
the gobble of a turkey, and four tremendous birds
rose up, and with a motion, that was partly a run
and partly a flying, they disappeared into the
depths of the forest. To their intense surprise,
the usually placid Younkins turned savagely upon
the dog, and saying, &#8220;Drat that fool dog!&#8221; fired
one barrel loaded with fine bird-shot into poor
Major.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four as fine wild turkeys as you ever saw in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
your life!&#8221; he explained, as if in apology to the
boys. &#8220;I was sure of at least two of &#8217;em; and
that lunkhead of a dog must needs dash in and
scare &#8217;em up. It&#8217;s too pesky blamed bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were greatly mortified at the disaster
that they had brought upon Younkins and Major
by bringing the dog out with them. But when
Charlie, as the eldest, explained that they had no
idea that Major would work mischief, Younkins
said, &#8220;Never mind, boys, for you did not know
what was going on-like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Younkins, ashamed, apparently, of his burst of
temper, stooped down, and discovering that Major&#8217;s
wounds were not very serious, extracted the shot,
plucked a few leaves of some plant that he seemed
to know all about, and pressed the juice into the
wounds made by the shot. The boys looked on
with silent admiration. This man knew everything,
they thought. They had often marvelled
to see how easily and unerringly he found his way
through woods, streams, and over prairies; now he
showed them another gift. He was a &#8220;natural-born
doctor,&#8221; as his wife proudly said of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No turkey for supper to-night,&#8221; said Younkins,
as he picked up his shot-gun and returned with
the boys to the cabin. He was &#8220;right glad,&#8221; he
said, to agree to go on a buffalo hunt, if the rest
of the party would like to go. He knew there
must be buffalo off to the westward. He went
with Mr. Fuller and Mr. Battles last year, about
this time, and they had great luck. He would
come over that evening and set a date with the
other men for starting out together.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>Elated with this ready consent of Younkins, the
lads went across the ford, eager to tell their elders
the story of the wild turkeys and poor Major&#8217;s exploit.
Sandy, carrying his shot-gun on his shoulder,
lingered behind while the other two boys hurried
up the trail to the log-cabin. He fancied that
he heard a noise as of ducks quacking, in the
creek that emptied into the Fork just below the
ford. So, making his way softly to the densely
wooded bank of the creek, he parted the branches
with great caution and looked in. What a sight
it was! At least fifty fine black ducks were swimming
around, feeding and quacking sociably together,
entirely unconscious of the wide-open blue
eyes that were staring at them from behind the
covert of the thicket. Sandy thought them even
more wonderful and beautiful than the young
fawn and his dam that he had seen on the Fort
Riley trail. For a moment, fascinated by the rare
spectacle, he gazed wonderingly at the ducks as
they swam around, chasing each other, and eagerly
hunting for food. It was but for a moment, however.
Then he raised his shot-gun, and taking
aim into the thickest of the flock, fired both barrels
in quick succession. Instantly the gay clamor of
the pretty creatures ceased, and the flock rose with
a loud whirring of wings, and wheeled away over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
the tree-tops. The surface of the water, to Sandy&#8217;s
excited imagination, seemed to be fairly covered
with birds, some dead, and some struggling with
wounded limbs. The other two boys, startled by
the double report from Sandy&#8217;s gun, came scampering
down the trail, just as the lad, all excitement,
was stripping off his clothes to wade into the creek
for his game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ducks! Black ducks! I&#8217;ve shot a million of
&#8217;em!&#8221; cried the boy, exultingly; and in another
instant he plunged into the water up to his middle,
gathering the ducks by the legs and bringing
them to the bank, where Charlie and Oscar, discreetly
keeping out of the oozy creek, received
them, counting the birds as they threw them on
the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen, all told!&#8221; shouted Oscar, when the
last bird had been caught, as it floundered about
among the weeds, and brought ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen ducks in two shots!&#8221; cried Sandy,
his freckled face fairly beaming with delight.
&#8220;Did ever anybody see such luck?&#8221;</p>
<p>They all thought that nobody ever had.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that on your leg?&#8221; asked Oscar, stooping
to pick from Sandy&#8217;s leg a long, brown object
looking like a flat worm. To the boys&#8217; intense
astonishment, the thing would not come off, but
stretched out several inches in length, holding on
by one end.</p>
<p>Sandy howled with pain. &#8220;It is something that
bites,&#8221; he cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s another,&ndash;&ndash;and another! Why,
he&#8217;s covered all over with &#8217;em!&#8221; exclaimed Oscar.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the lad&#8217;s legs, if not exactly covered,
were well sprinkled with the things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scrape &#8217;em off with your knife!&#8221; cried Sandy.</p>
<p>Oscar usually carried a sheath-knife at his belt,
&#8220;more for the style of the thing, than use,&#8221; he explained;
so with this he quickly took off the repulsive
creatures, which, loosening their hold, dropped
to the ground limp and shapeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leeches,&#8221; said Charlie, briefly, as he poked one
of them over with a stick. The mystery was explained,
and wherever one of them had been attached
to the boy&#8217;s tender skin, blood flowed freely for a
few minutes, and then ceased. Even on one or
two of the birds they found a leech adhering to
the feathers where the poor thing&#8217;s blood had followed
the shot. Picking up the game, the two
boys escorted the elated Sandy to the cabin, where
his unexpected adventures made him the hero of
the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we catch some of those leeches and
sell them to the doctors?&#8221; asked the practical
Oscar.</p>
<p>His father shook his head. &#8220;American wild
leeches like those are not good for much, my son.
I don&#8217;t know why not; but I have been told that
only the imported leeches are used by medical
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sandy, tenderly rubbing his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
wounded legs, &#8220;if imported leeches can bite any
more furiously than these Kansas ones do, I don&#8217;t
want any of them to tackle me! I suppose these
were hungry, though, not having had a taste of a
fresh Illinois boy lately. But they didn&#8217;t make
much out of me, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very happy were those three boys that evening,
as, filled with roast wild duck, they sat by and
heard their elders discuss with Younkins the details
of the grand buffalo hunt that was now to be
organized. Younkins had seen Mr. Fuller, who
had agreed to make one of the party. So there
would be four men and the three boys to compose
the expedition. They were to take two horses,
Fuller&#8217;s and Younkins&#8217;s, to serve as pack-animals,
for the way to the hunting-ground might be long;
but the hunting was to be done on foot. Younkins
was very sure that they would have no difficulty
in getting near enough to shoot; the animals had
not been hunted much in those parts at that time,
and the Indians killed them on foot very often. If
Indians could do that, why could not white men?</p>
<p>The next two days were occupied in preparations
for the expedition, to the great delight of the boys,
who recalled with amusement something of a similar
feeling that they had when they were preparing
for their trip to Kansas, long ago, away back
in Dixon. How far off that all seemed now!
Now they were in the promised land, and were
going out to hunt for big game&ndash;&ndash;buffalo! It
seemed too good to be true.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Bread was made and baked; smoked side-meat,
and pepper and salt packed; a few potatoes taken,
as a luxury in camp-life; blankets, guns, and ammunition
prepared; and above all, plenty of coffee,
already browned and ground, was packed for use.
It was a merry and a buoyant company that started
out in the early dawn of a September morning,
having snatched a hasty breakfast, of which the
excited boys had scarcely time to taste. Buffalo
beef, they confidently said, was their favorite
meat. They would dine on buffalo hump that
very day.</p>
<p>Oscar, more cautious than the others, asked Younkins
if they were sure to see buffalo soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; replied he; &#8220;I was out to the bend of
the Fork just above the bluffs, last night, and the
plains were just full of &#8217;em, just simply black-like,
as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed all three boys, in a breath.
&#8220;Plains full of them, and you didn&#8217;t even mention
it! What a funny man you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Howell reminded them that Mr. Younkins
had been accustomed to see buffalo for so long
that he did not think it anything worth mentioning
that he had seen vast numbers of the creatures
already. So, as they pressed on, the boys strained
their eyes in the distance, looking for buffalo.
But no animals greeted their sight, as they passed
over the long green swales of the prairie, mile
after mile, now rising to the top of a little eminence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
and now sinking into a shallow valley; but
occasionally a sneaking, stealthy coyote would
noiselessly trot into view, and then, after cautiously
surveying them from a distance, disappear, as
Sandy said, &#8220;as if he had sunk into a hole in the
ground.&#8221; It was in vain that they attempted to
get near enough to one of these wary animals to
warrant a shot. It is only by great good luck that
anybody ever shoots a coyote, although in countries
where they abound every man&#8217;s hand is
against them; they are such arrant thieves, as well
as cowards.</p>
<p>But at noon, while the little party was taking a
luncheon in the shade of a solitary birch that grew
by the side of a little creek, or runlet, Sandy, the
irrepressible, with his bread and meat in his hand,
darted off to the next roll of the prairie, a high
and swelling hill, in fact, &#8220;to see what he could
see.&#8221; As soon as the lad had reached the highest
part of the swale, he turned around and swung his
arms excitedly, too far off to make his voice heard.
He jumped up and down, whirled his arms, and
acted altogether like a young lunatic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy sees buffalo,&#8221; said Younkins, with a
smile of calm amusement. He could hardly understand
why anybody should be excited over so
commonplace a matter. But the other two lads
were off like a shot in Sandy&#8217;s direction. Reaching
their comrade, they found him in a state of
great agitation. &#8220;Oh, look at &#8217;em! Look at &#8217;em!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Millions on millions! Did anybody ever see the
like?&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps Sandy&#8217;s estimate of the numbers was a
little exaggerated, but it really was a wonderful
sight. The rolls of the prairie, four or five miles
away, were dark with the vast and slow-moving
herds that were passing over, their general direction
being toward the spot on which the boys were
standing. Now and again, some animals strayed
off in broken parties, but for the most part the
phalanx seemed to be solid, so solid that the green
of the earth was completely hidden by the dense
herd.</p>
<p>The boys stood rooted to the spot with the intensity
of their wonder and delight. If there were
not millions in that vast army of buffalo, there
were certainly hundreds of thousands. What
would happen if that great mob should suddenly
take a notion to gallop furiously in their direction?</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t whisper so,&#8221; said Charlie, noticing
the awe-struck tones of the youngsters. &#8220;They
can&#8217;t hear you, away off there. Why, the very
nearest of the herd cannot be less than five miles
off; and they would run from us, rather than
toward us, if they were to see and hear us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked Younkins if he ever had any trouble
with a buffalo when he was hunting, and what do
you suppose he said?&#8221; asked Oscar, who had recovered
his voice. &#8220;Well, he said that once he
was out on horseback, and had cornered a young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
buffalo bull in among some limestone ledges up
there on the Upper Fork, and &#8216;the critter turned
on him and made a nasty noise with his mouth-like,&#8217;
so that he was glad to turn and run. &#8216;Nasty
noise with his mouth,&#8217; I suppose was a sort of a
snort&ndash;&ndash;a snort-like, as Younkins would say.
There come the rest of the folks. My! won&#8217;t
daddy be provoked that we didn&#8217;t go back and
help hitch up!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the elders of the party had not forgotten
that they were once boys themselves, and when
they reached the point on which the lads stood
surveying the sight, they also were stirred to
enthusiasm. The great herd was still moving on,
the dark folds of the moving mass undulating like
the waves of a sea, as the buffalo rose and fell
upon the surface of the rolling prairie.</p>
<p>As if the leaders had spied the hunters, the
main herd now swung away more to the right, or
northward, only a few detached parties coming
toward the little group of hunters that still watched
them silently from its elevated point of observation.</p>
<p>Younkins surveyed the movement critically and
then announced it as his opinion that the herd was
bound for the waters of the Republican Fork, to
the right and somewhat to the northward of the
party. The best course for them to take now
would be to try and cut off the animals before
they could reach the river. There was a steep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and bluffy bank at the point for which the buffalo
seemed to be aiming; that would divert them
further up stream, and if the hunters could only
creep along in the low gullies of the prairie, out of
the sight of the herd, they might reach the place
where the buffalo would cross before they could
get there; for the herd moved slowly; an expert
walker could far out-travel them in a direct line.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of you boys will have to stay here by the
stuff; the rest of us will press on in the direction
of the river as fast as may be,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck.
The boys looked at each other in dismay. Who
would be willing to be left behind in a chase so
exciting as this? Sandy bravely solved the puzzle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you take my shot-gun, Charlie,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It carries farther than yours; I&#8217;ll stay by the
stuff and the horses; I&#8217;m pretty tired, anyhow.&#8221;
His father smiled approvingly, but said nothing.
He knew how great a sacrifice the boy was making
for the others.</p>
<p>Left alone on the hill-top, for the rest of the
party moved silently and swiftly away to the
northward, Sandy felt the bitterness of disappointment
as well as of loneliness while he sat on the
grass watching with absorbed attention the motions
of the great herds. All trace of his companions
was soon lost as they passed down into
the gullies and ravines that broke the ground
adjacent to the Fork to the westward of the
stream. Once, indeed, he saw the figures of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
hunters, painted dark against the sky, rise over a
distant swell and disappear just as one of them
turned and waved a signal in dumb show to the
solitary watcher on the hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;If those buffalo should get stampeded,&#8221; mused
Sandy, &#8220;and make a break in this way, it would
be &#8216;all day&#8217; with those horses and the camp stuff.
I guess I had better make all fast, for there may
be a gale of wind, or a gale of buffalo, which is
the same thing.&#8221; So saying, the thoughtful lad
led the animals down into the gully where the
noon luncheon had been taken, removed their
packs, tethered them to the tree, and then ran
back to the hill-top and resumed his watch.</p>
<p>There was no change in the situation except
that there were, if possible, more buffalo moving
over the distant slopes of the rolling prairie. The
boy stood entranced at the sight. More, more, and
yet more of the herds were slowly moving into
sight and then disappearing in the gullies below.
The dark brown folds seemed to envelop the face
of the earth. Sandy wondered where so many
creatures could find pasturage. Their bodies appeared
to cover the hills and valleys, so that there
could not be room left for grazing. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
got such big feet,&#8221; he soliloquized aloud, &#8220;that I
should think that the ground would be all pawed
up where they have travelled.&#8221; In the ecstasy of
his admiration, he walked to and fro on the hill-top,
talking to himself, as was his wont.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if the other fellows can see them as
I do?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe, after all, that
it is one-half so entertaining for them as it is for
me. Oh, I just wish the folks at home could be
here now, and see this sight. It beats all nature,
as Father Dixon used to say. And to think that
there are thousands of people in big cities who
don&#8217;t have meat enough to eat. And all this
buffalo-meat running wild!&#8221; The boy laughed to
himself at the comicality of the thought. &#8220;Fresh
beef running wild!&#8221;</p>
<p>The faint report of a gun fired afar off now
reached his ear and he saw a blue puff of smoke
rising from the crest of a timber-bordered hill far
away. The herd in that direction seemed to
swerve somewhat and scatter, but, to his intense
surprise, there was no hurry in their movements;
the brown and black folds of the great mass of
animals still slowly and sluggishly spread out and
flowed like the tides of the sea, enveloping everything.
Suddenly there was another report, then
another, and another. Three shots in quick succession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they are getting in their work!&#8221; shouted
the boy, fairly dancing up and down in his excitement.
&#8220;Oh, I wish I was there instead of here
looking on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the herds wavered for a moment, then their
general direction was changed from the northward
to the eastward. Then there was a swift and sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
movement of the whole mass, and the vast
dark stream flowed in a direction parallel with the
Fork instead of toward it, as heretofore.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are coming this way!&#8221; shouted Sandy,
to the empty, silent air around him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a
shot at &#8217;em yet!&#8221; Then, suddenly recollecting
that his gun had been exchanged for his brother&#8217;s,
he added, &#8220;And Charlie&#8217;s gun is no good!&#8221;</p>
<p>In truth, the herd was now bound straight for
the hill on which the boy maintained his solitary
watch. Swiftly running down to the gully in
which the horses were tethered, Sandy got out
his brother&#8217;s gun and carefully examined the
caps and the load. They had run some heavy
slugs of lead in a rude mould which they had
made, the slug being just the size of the barrel
of the shot-gun. One barrel was loaded with a
heavy charge of buckshot, and the other with a
slug. The latter was an experiment, and a big
slug like that could not be expected to carry
very far; it might, however, do much damage at
short range.</p>
<p>Running up to the head of the gully, which was
in the nature of a shallow ravine draining the hill
above, Sandy emerged on the highest point of
land, a few hundred feet to the right and north of
his former post of observation. The herd was in
full drive directly toward him. Suppose they
should come driving down over the hills where he
was! They would sweep down into the gully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
stampede the horses, and trample all the camp stuff
into bits! The boy fairly shook with excitement
as the idea struck him. On they came, the solid
ground shaking under their thundering tread.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must try to head &#8217;em off,&#8221; said the boy to
himself. &#8220;The least I can do is to scare them a
good bit, and then they&#8217;ll split in two and the herd
will divide right here. But I must get a shot at
one, or the other fellows will laugh at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rushing herd was headed right for the spot
where Sandy stood, spreading out to the left and
right, but with the centre of the phalanx steering
in a bee-line for the lad. Thoroughly alarmed
now, Sandy looked around, and perceiving a sharp
outcropping of the underlying stratum of limestone
at the head of the little ravine, he resolved
to shelter himself behind that, in case the buffalo
should continue to come that way. Notwithstanding
his excitement, the lad did not fail to note
two discharges, one after the other, in the distance,
showing that his friends were still keeping up a
fusillade against the flying herds.</p>
<p>At the second shot, Sandy thought that the
masses in the rear swung off more to the southward,
as if panic-stricken by the firing, but the
advance guard still maintained a straight line for
him. There was no escape from it now, and Sandy
looked down at the two horses tethered in the
ravine below, peacefully grazing the short, thick
grass, unconscious of the flood of buffalo undulating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
over the prairie above them, and soon to swoop
down over the hill-side where they were. In another
instant the lad could see the tossing, shaggy
manes of the leaders of the herd, and could even
distinguish the redness of their eyes as they swept
up the incline, at the head of which he stood. He
hastily dodged behind the crag of rock; it was a
small affair, hardly higher than his head, but wide
enough, he thought, to divide the herd when they
came to it. So he ducked behind it and waited
for coming events.</p>
<p>Sandy was right. Just beyond the rock behind
which he was crouched, the ground fell off rapidly
and left a stiff slope, up which even a stampeded
buffalo would hardly climb. The ground trembled
as the vast army of living creatures came tumbling
and thundering over the prairie. Sandy, stooping
behind the outcropping, also trembled, partly with
excitement and partly with fear. If the buffalo
were to plunge over the very small barrier between
him and them, his fate was sealed. For an instant
his heart stood still. It was but for an instant,
for, before he could draw a long breath, the herd
parted on the two sides of the little crag. The
divided stream poured down on both sides of him,
a tumultuous, broken, and disorderly torrent of
animals, making no sound except for the ceaseless
beat of their tremendous hoofs. Sandy&#8217;s eyes
swam with the bewildering motion of the living
stream. For a brief space he saw nothing but a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
confused mass of heads, backs, and horns, hundreds
of thousands flowing tumultuously past. Gradually
his sense of security came back to him, and,
exulting in his safety, he raised his gun, and muttering
under his breath, &#8220;Right behind the fore-shoulder-like,
Younkins said,&#8221; he took steady aim
and fired. A young buffalo bull tumbled headlong
down the ravine. In their mad haste, a number
of the animals fell over him, pell-mell, but, recovering
themselves with incredible swiftness, they
skipped to their feet, and were speedily on their
way down the hill. Sandy watched, with a beating
heart, the young bull as he fell heels over head
two or three times before he could rally; the poor
creature got upon his feet, fell again, and while
the tender-hearted boy hesitated whether to fire
the second barrel or not, finally fell over on his
side helpless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the ranks of buffalo coming behind
swerved from the fallen animal to the left and
right, as if by instinct, leaving an open space all
around the point where the boy stood gazing at
his fallen game. He fired, almost at random, at
the nearest of the flying buffalo; but the buckshot
whistled hurtlessly among the herd, and Sandy
thought to himself that it was downright cruelty
to shoot among them, for the scattering shot would
only wound without killing the animals.</p>
<p>It was safe now for Sandy to emerge from his
place of concealment, and, standing on the rocky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
point behind which he had been hidden, he gazed
to the west and north. The tumbling masses of
buffalo were scattered far apart. Here and there
he could see wide stretches of prairie, no longer
green, but trampled into a dull brown by the tread
of myriads of hurrying feet; and far to the north
the land was clear, as if the main herd had passed
down to the southward. Scattered bands still
hurried along above him, here and there, nearer
to the Fork, but the main herd had gone on in the
general direction of the settlers&#8217; home.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if they have gone down to our cabin?&#8221;
he muttered aloud. &#8220;It&#8217;s all up with any corn-field
that they run across. But, then, they must
have kept too far to the south to get anywhere
near our claim.&#8221; And the lad consoled himself
with this reflection.</p>
<p>But his game was more engrossing of his attention
just now than anything else. He had been
taught that an animal should not bleed to death
through a gunshot wound. His big leaden slug
had gone directly through the buffalo&#8217;s vitals somewhere,
for it was now quite dead. Sandy stood
beside the noble beast with a strange elation, looking
at it before he could make up his mind to cut
its throat and let out the blood. It was a young
bull buffalo that lay before him, the short, sharp
horns ploughed into the ground, and the massive
form, so lately bounding over the rolling prairie,
forever still. To Sandy it all seemed like a dream,
it had come and gone so quickly. His heart misgave
him as he looked, for Sandy had a tender
heart. Then he gently touched the animal with
the toe of his boot and cried, &#8220;All by my own
self!&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well done, Sandy!&#8221; The boy started, turned,
and beheld his cousin Oscar gazing open-mouthed
at the spectacle. &#8220;And did you shoot him all by
your very own self? What with? Charlie&#8217;s gun?&#8221;
The lad poured forth a torrent of questions, and
Sandy proudly answered them all with, &#8220;That is
what I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the two boys hung with delight over the
prostrate beast, Oscar told the tale of disappointment
that the others had to relate. They had
gone up the ravines that skirted the Fork, prowling
on their hands and knees; but the watchers of
the herd were too wary to let the hunters get near
enough for a good shot. They had fired several
times, but had brought down nothing. Sandy
had heard the shots? Yes, Sandy had heard, and
had hoped that somebody was having great sport.
After all, he thought, as he looked at the fallen
monarch of the prairie, it was rather cruel business.
Oscar did not think so; he wished he had had
such luck.</p>
<p>The rest of the party now came up, one after
another, and all gave a whoop of astonishment
and delight at Sandy&#8217;s great success as soon as
they saw his noble quarry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>The sun was now low in the west; here was a
good place for camping; a little brush would do
for firing, and water was close at hand. So the
tired hunters, after a brief rest, while they lay on
the trampled grass and recounted the doings of
the day, went to work at the game. The animal
was dressed, and a few choice pieces were hung on
the tree to cool for their supper. It was dark
when they gathered around their cheerful fire, as
the cool autumnal evening came on, and cooked
and ate with infinite zest their first buffalo-meat.
Boys who have never been hungry with the hunger
of a long tramp over the prairies, hungry for
their first taste of big game of their own shooting,
cannot possibly understand how good to the Boy
Settlers was their supper on the wind-swept slopes
of the Kansas plains.</p>
<p>Wrapping themselves as best they could in
the blankets and buffalo-robes brought from home,
the party lay down in the nooks and corners of the
ravine, first securing the buffalo-meat on the tree
that made their camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, for goodness&#8217; sake, is that?&#8221; asked
Charlie, querulously, as he was roused out of his
sleep by a dismal cry not far away in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolves,&#8221; said Younkins, curtly, as he raised
himself on one elbow to listen. &#8220;The pesky critters
have smelt blood; they would smell it if they
were twenty miles off, I do believe, and they are
gathering round as they scent the carcass.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>By this, all of the party were awake except
Sandy, who, worn out with excitement, perhaps,
slept on through all the fearful din. The mean
little prairie-wolves gathered, and barked, and
snarled, in the distance. Nearer, the big wolves
howled like great dogs, their long howl occasionally
breaking into a bark; and farther and
farther off, away in the extremest distance, they
could hear other wolves, whose hollow-sounding
cry seemed like an echo of their more fortunate
brethren, nearer the game. A party of the creatures
were busy at the offal from the slain buffalo,
just without the range of the firelight, for the
camp-fire had been kept alight. Into the struggling,
snarling group Younkins discharged his
rifle. There was a sharp yell of pain, a confused
patter of hurrying feet, and in an instant all was
still.</p>
<p>Sandy started up. &#8220;Who&#8217;s shot another buffalo?&#8221;
he asked, as if struggling with a dream.
The others laughed, and Charlie explained what
had been going on, and the tired boy lay down to
sleep again. But that was not a restful night for
any of the campers. The wolves renewed their
howling. The hunters were able to snatch only a
few breaths of sleep from time to time, in moments
when the dismal ululation of the wolf-chorus subsided.
The sun rose, flooding the rolling prairies
with a wealth of golden sunshine. The weary
campers looked over the expanse around them, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
not a remnant of the rejected remains of the buffalo
was to be seen; and in all the landscape about,
no sign of any living thing was in sight, save
where some early-rising jack-rabbit scudded over
the torn sod, hunting for his breakfast.</p>
<p>Fresh air, bright sunlight, and a dip in a cool
stream are the best correctives for a head heavy
with want of sleep; and the hunters, refreshed by
these and a pot of strong and steaming coffee, were
soon ready for another day&#8217;s sport.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>A GREAT DISASTER.</h3>
</div>
<p>The hunters had better success on their second
day&#8217;s search for buffalo; for they not only found
the animals, but they killed three. The first game
of the day was brought down by Younkins, who
was the &#8220;guide, philosopher, and friend&#8221; of the
party, and Oscar, the youngest of them all, slew
the second. The honor of bringing down the third
and last was Uncle Aleck&#8217;s. When he had killed
his game, he was anxious to get home as soon as
possible, somewhat to the amusement of the others,
who rallied him on his selfishness. They hinted
that he would not be so ready to go home, if he yet
had his buffalo to kill, as had some of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about the crop, to tell the truth,&#8221;
said Mr. Howell. &#8220;If that herd of buffalo swept
down on our claim, there&#8217;s precious little corn left
there now; and it seemed to me that they went in
that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said the easy-going Younkins,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the use of going home? If the corn
is gone, you can&#8217;t get it back by looking at the
place where it was.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>They laughed at this cool and practical way of
looking at things, and Uncle Aleck was half
ashamed to admit he wanted to be rid of his present
suspense, and could not be satisfied until he
had settled in his mind all that he dreaded and
feared.</p>
<p>It was a long and wearisome tramp homeward.
But they had been more successful than they had
hoped or expected, and the way did not seem so
long as it would if they had been empty-handed.
The choicest parts of their game had been carefully
cooled by hanging in the dry Kansas wind, over
night, and were now loaded upon the pack-animals.
There was enough and more than enough for each
of the three families represented in the party; and
they had enjoyed many a savory repast of buffalo-meat
cooked hunter-fashion before an open camp-fire,
while their expedition lasted. So they hailed
with pleasure the crooked line of bluffs that marks
the big bend of the Republican Fork near which
the Whittier cabin was built. Here and there they
had crossed the trail, broad and well pounded, of
the great herd that had been stampeded on the first
day of their hunt. But for the most part the track
of the animal multitude bore off more to the south,
and the hunters soon forgot their apprehensions
of danger to the corn-fields left unfenced on their
claim.</p>
<p>It was sunset when the weary pilgrims reached
the bluff that overlooked the Younkins cabin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
where the Dixon party temporarily dwelt. The
red light of the sun deluged with splendor the
waving grass of the prairie below them, and jack-rabbits
scurrying hither and yon were the only
signs of life in the peaceful picture. Tired as he
was, Oscar could not resist taking a shot at one of
the flying creatures; but before he could raise his
gun to his shoulder, the long-legged, long-eared
rabbit was out of range. Running briskly for a
little distance, it squatted in the tall grass. Piqued
at this, Oscar stealthily followed on the creature&#8217;s
trail. &#8220;It will make a nice change from so much
buffalo-meat,&#8221; said the lad to himself, &#8220;and if I
get him into the corn-field, he can&#8217;t hide so easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw Jack&#8217;s long ears waving against the sky
on the next rise of ground, as he muttered this to
himself, and he pressed forward, resolved on one
parting shot. He mounted the roll of the prairie,
and before him lay the corn-field. It was what
had been a corn-field! Where had stood, on the
morning of their departure, a glorious field of gold
and green, the blades waving in the breeze like
banners, was now a mass of ruin. The tumultuous
drove had plunged down over the ridge above the
field, and had fled, in one broad swath of destruction,
straight over every foot of the field, their
trail leaving a brown and torn surface on the earth,
wide on both sides of the plantation. Scarcely a
trace of greenness was left where once the corn-field
had been. Here and there, ears of grain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
broken and trampled into the torn earth, hinted
what had been; but for the most part hillock,
stalk, corn-blade, vine, and melon were all crushed
into an indistinguishable confusion, muddy and
wrecked.</p>
<p>Oscar felt a shudder pass down his back, and
his knees well-nigh gave way under him as he
caught a glimpse of the ruin that had been wrought.
Tears were in his eyes, and, unable to raise a shout,
he turned and wildly waved his hands to the party,
who had just then reached the door of the cabin.
His Uncle Aleck had been watching the lad, and
as he saw him turn he exclaimed, &#8220;Oscar has
found the buffalo trail over the corn-field!&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole party moved quickly in the direction
of the plantation. When they reached the rise of
ground overlooking the field, Oscar, still unable to
speak, turned and looked at his father with a face
of grief. Uncle Aleck, gazing on the wreck and
ruin, said only, &#8220;A whole summer&#8217;s work gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dearly bought buffalo-hunt!&#8221; remarked
Younkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, neighbor,&#8221; added Mr. Bryant, with
the grimmest sort of a smile; and then the men
fell to talking calmly of the wonderful amount of
mischief that a drove of buffalo could do in a few
minutes, even seconds, of time. Evidently, the
animals had not stopped to snatch a bite by the
way. They had not tarried an instant in their
wild course. Down the slope of the fields they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
had hurried in a mad rush, plunged into the woody
creek below, and, leaving the underbrush and
vines broken and flattened as if a tornado had
passed through the land, had thundered away
across the flat floor of the bottom-land on the
further side of the creek. A broad brown track
behind them showed that they had then fled into
the dim distance of the lands of the Chapman&#8217;s
Creek region.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done, and not much to
be said. So, parting with their kindly and sympathizing
neighbors, the party went sorrowfully
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck, as soon as they were
alone together, &#8220;I am awful sorry that we have
lost the corn; but I am not so sure that it is so
very great a loss, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys looked at him with amazement, and
Sandy said,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, daddy, it&#8217;s the loss of a whole summer;
isn&#8217;t it? What are we going to live on this whole
winter that&#8217;s coming, now that we have no corn
to sell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no market for free-State corn in these
parts, Sandy,&#8221; replied his father; and, seeing the
look of inquiry on the lad&#8217;s face, he explained:
&#8220;Mr. Fuller tells us that the officer at the post,
the quartermaster at Fort Riley who buys for the
Government, will buy no grain from free-State
men. Several from the Smoky Hill and from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Chapman&#8217;s have been down there to find a market,
and they all say the same thing. The sutler at
the post, Sandy&#8217;s friend, told Mr. Fuller that it
was no use for any free-State man to come there
with anything to sell to the Government, at any
price. And there is no other good market nearer
than the Missouri, you all know that,&ndash;&ndash;one hundred
and fifty miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call that confoundedly mean!&#8221; cried
Charlie, with fiery indignation. &#8220;Do you suppose,
father, that they have from Washington any such
instructions to discriminate against us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say as to that, Charlie,&#8221; replied his
father; &#8220;I only tell you what the other settlers
report; and it sounds reasonable. That is why
the ruin of the corn-field is not so great a misfortune
as it might have been.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE WOLF AT THE DOOR.</h3>
</div>
<p>Uncle Aleck and Mr. Bryant had gone over
to Chapman&#8217;s Creek to make inquiries about the
prospect of obtaining corn for their cattle through
the coming winter, as the failure of their own crop
had made that the next thing to be considered.
The three boys were over at the Younkins cabin
in quest of news from up the river, where, it was
said, a party of California emigrants had been fired
upon by the Indians. They found that the party
attacked was one coming from California, not
migrating thither. It brought the Indian frontier
very near the boys to see the shot-riddled wagons,
left at Younkins&#8217;s by the travellers. The Cheyennes
had shot into the party and had killed four
and wounded two, at a point known as Buffalo
Creek, some one hundred miles or so up the Republican
Fork. It was a daring piece of effrontery,
as there were two military posts not very far away,
Fort Kearney above and Fort Riley below.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they are far enough away by this time,&#8221;
said Younkins, with some bitterness. &#8220;Those
military posts are good for nothin&#8217; but to run to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
in case of trouble. No soldiers can get out into
the plains from any of them quick enough to catch
the slowest Indian of the lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie was unwilling to disagree with anything
that Younkins said, for he had the highest respect
for the opinions of this experienced old plainsman.
But he couldn&#8217;t help reminding him that it would
take a very big army to follow up every stray
band of Indians, provided any of the tribes should
take a notion to go on the warpath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about this time, though, the men that
were stationed at Fort Riley are all down at
Lawrence to keep the free-State people from
sweeping the streets with free-State brooms, or
something that-a-way,&#8221; said Younkins, determined
to have his gibe at the useless soldiery, as he
seemed to think them. Oscar was interested at
once. Anything that related to the politics of
Kansas the boy listened to greedily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something like this,&#8221; explained Younkins.
&#8220;You see the free-State men have got a government
there at Lawrence which is lawful under the
Topeka Legislator&#8217;, as it were. The border-State
men have got a city government under the Lecompton
Legislatur&#8217;; and so the two are quarrelling
to see which shall govern the city; &#8217;tisn&#8217;t
much of a city, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what have the troops from Fort Riley to
do with it? I don&#8217;t see that yet,&#8221; said Oscar,
with some heat.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Younkins, &#8220;I am a poor hand at
politics; but the way I understand it is that the
Washington Government is in favor of the border-State
fellows, and so the troops have been sent
down to stand by the mayor that belongs to the
Lecompton fellows. Leastways, that is the way
the sutler down to the post put it to me when I
was down there with the folks that were fired on
up to Buffalo Creek; I talked with him about it
yesterday. That&#8217;s why I said they were at Lawrence
to prevent the streets being swept by free-State
brooms. That is the sutler&#8217;s joke. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call outrageous,&#8221; cried Oscar,
his eyes snapping with excitement. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
people up here on the frontier being massacred by
Indians, while the Government troops are down at
Lawrence in a political quarrel!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys were so excited over this state of
things that they paid very little attention to anything
else while on their way back to the cabin,
full of the news of the day. Usually, there was
not much news to discuss on the Fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that by the cabin-door?&#8221; said Sandy,
falling back as he looked up the trail and beheld
a tall white, or light gray, animal smelling around
the door-step of the cabin, only a half-mile away.
It seemed to be about as large as a full-grown
calf, and it moved stealthily about, and yet with a
certain unconcern, as if not used to being scared
easily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wolf!&#8221; cried Oscar. &#8220;The Sunday that
Uncle Aleck and I saw one from the bluff yonder,
he was just like that. Hush, Sandy, don&#8217;t talk so
loud, or you&#8217;ll frighten him off before we can get
a crack at him. Let&#8217;s go up the trail by the
ravine, and perhaps we can get a shot before he
sees us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was seldom that the boys stirred abroad without
firearms of some sort. This time they had a
shot-gun and a rifle with them, and, examining
the weapons as they went, they ran down into a
dry gully, to follow which would bring them unperceived
almost as directly to the cabin as by the
regular trail. As noiselessly as possible, the boys
ran up the gully trail, their hearts beating high
with expectation. It would be a big feather in
their caps if they could only have a gray wolf&#8217;s
skin to show their elders on their return from
Chapman&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go round the upper side of the house with
your rifle, Oscar, and I&#8217;ll go round the south side
with the shot-gun,&#8221; was Charlie&#8217;s advice to his
cousin when they had reached the spring at the
head of the gully, back of the log-cabin. With
the utmost caution, the two boys crept around opposite
corners of the house, each hoping he would
be lucky enough to secure the first shot. Sandy
remained behind, waiting with suppressed excitement
for the shot. Instead of the report of a firearm,
he heard a peal of laughter from both boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried, rushing from his place
of concealment. &#8220;What&#8217;s the great joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Oscar, laughing heartily, &#8220;only
that as I was stealing around the corner here by
the corral, Charlie was tiptoeing round the other
corner with his eyes bulging out of his head as if
he expected to see that wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Charlie, &#8220;and if Oscar had been
a little quicker, he would have fired at me. He
had his gun aimed right straight ahead as he came
around the corner of the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that wolf is probably miles and miles
away from here by this time, while you two fellows
were sneaking around to find him. Just as if he
was going to wait here for you!&#8221; It was Sandy&#8217;s
turn to laugh, then.</p>
<p>The boys examined the tracks left in the soft
loam of the garden by the strange animal, and
came to the conclusion that it must have been a
very large wolf, for its footsteps were deep as if it
were a heavy creature, and their size was larger
than that of any wolf-tracks they had ever seen.</p>
<p>When the elders heard the story on their arrival
from Chapman&#8217;s, that evening, Uncle Aleck remarked
with some grimness, &#8220;So the wolf is at
the door at last, boys.&#8221; The lads by this understood
that poverty could not be far off; but they
could not comprehend that poverty could affect
them in a land where so much to live upon was
running wild, so to speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this that rides so fast?&#8221; queried
Charlie, a day or two after the wolf adventure, as
he saw a stranger riding up the trail from the ford.
It was very seldom that any visitor, except the
good Younkins, crossed their ford. And Younkins
always came over on foot.</p>
<p>Here was a horseman who rode as if in haste.
The unaccustomed sight drew all hands around
the cabin to await the coming of the stranger, who
rode as if he were on some important errand bent.
It was Battles. His errand was indeed momentous.
A corporal from the post had come to his
claim, late in the night before, bidding him warn
all the settlers on the Fork that the Cheyennes
were coming down the Smoky Hill, plundering,
burning, and slaying the settlers. Thirteen white
people had been killed in the Smoky Hill country,
and the savages were evidently making their way
to the fort, which at that time was left in an
unprotected condition. The commanding officer
sent word to all settlers that if they valued their
lives they would abandon their claims and fly to
the fort for safety. Arms and ammunition would
be furnished to all who came. Haste was necessary,
for the Indians were moving rapidly down
the Smoky Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Smoky Hill is twenty-five or thirty
miles from here,&#8221; said Mr. Bryant; &#8220;why should
they strike across the plains between here and
there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>Battles did not know; but he supposed, from
his talk with the corporal, that it was expected
that the Cheyennes would not go quite to the fort,
but, having raided the Smoky Hill country down
as near to the post as might seem safe, they would
strike across to the Republican Fork at some
narrow point between the two rivers, travel up
that stream, and so go back to the plains from
which they came, robbing and burning by the way.</p>
<p>The theory seemed a reasonable one. Such a
raid was like Indian warfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men are there at the post?&#8221; asked
Uncle Aleck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten men including the corporal and a lieutenant
of cavalry,&#8221; replied Battles, who was a pro-slavery
man. &#8220;The rest are down at Lawrence to
suppress the rebellion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the commanding officer at the post wants
us to come down and help defend the fort, which
has been left to take care of itself while the troops
are at Lawrence keeping down the free-State men,&#8221;
said Mr. Bryant, bitterly. &#8220;For my part, I don&#8217;t
feel like going. How is it with you, Aleck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we had better take care of ourselves
and the boys, Charlie,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck, cheerily.
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty mean for Uncle Sam to leave the
settlers to take care of themselves and the post at
this critical time, I know; but we can&#8217;t afford to
quibble about that now. Safety is the first consideration.
What does Younkins say?&#8221; he asked
of Battles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A randyvoo has been appointed at my house
to-night,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;and Younkins said he
would be there before sundown. He told me to
tell you not to wait for him; he would meet you
there. He has sent his wife and children over to
Fuller&#8217;s, and Fuller has agreed to send them with
Mrs. Fuller over to the Big Blue, where there is
no danger. Fuller will be back to my place by
midnight. There is no time to fool away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was an unexpected crisis. The country
was evidently alarmed and up in arms. An Indian
raid, even if over twenty miles away, was a
terror that they had not reckoned on. After a
hurried consultation, the Whittier settlers agreed
to be at the &#8220;randyvoo,&#8221; as Battles called it, before
daybreak next morning. They thought it
best to take his advice and hide what valuables
they had in the cabin, make all snug, and leave
things as if they never expected to see their home
again, and take their way to the post as soon as
possible.</p>

<span class='smcap'>The Retreat to Battles&#8217;s.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>It was yet early morning, for Mr. Battles had
wasted no time in warning the settlers as soon as
he had received notice from the fort. They had
all the day before them for their preparations. So
the settlers, leaving other plans for the time, went
zealously to work packing up and secreting in the
thickets and the gully the things they thought
most valuable and they were least willing to spare.
Clothing, crockery, and table knives and forks
were wrapped up in whatever came handy and
were buried in holes dug in the ploughed ground.
Lead, bullets, slugs, and tools of various kinds
were buried or concealed in the forks of trees,
high up and out of sight. Where any articles
were buried in the earth, a fire was afterwards
built on the surface so that no trace of the disturbed
ground should be left to show the expected
redskins that goods had been there concealed.
They lamented that a sack of flour and a keg of
molasses could not be put away, and that their
supply of side-meat, which had cost them a long
journey to Manhattan, must be abandoned to the
foe&ndash;&ndash;if he came to take it. But everything that
could be hidden in trees or buried in the earth was
so disposed of as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps the boys, after the first flush of apprehension
had passed, rather enjoyed the novelty
and the excitement. Their spirits rose as they
privately talked among themselves of the real
Indian warfare of which this was a foretaste. They
hoped that it would be nothing worse. When the
last preparations were made, and they were ready
to depart from their home, uncertain whether they
would ever see it again, Sandy, assisted by Oscar,
composed the following address. It was written
in a big, boyish hand on a sheet of letter-paper,
and was left on the table in the middle of their
cabin:&ndash;&ndash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '><span class='smcap'>Good Mister Indian:</span> We are leaving in a hurry and
we want you to be careful of the fire when you come. Don&#8217;t
eat the corn-meal in the sack in the corner; it is poisoned.
The flour is full of crickets, and crickets are not good for the
stomach. Don&#8217;t fool with the matches, nor waste the molasses.
Be done as you would do by, for that is the golden
rule.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 8.203125em;'>Yours truly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'><span class='smcap'>The Whittier Settlers</span>.</span><br /></p>
<p>Even in the midst of their uneasiness and
trouble, their elders laughed at this unique composition,
although Mr. Bryant thought that the
boys had mixed their version of the golden rule.
Sandy said that no Cheyenne would be likely to
improve upon it. So, with many misgivings, the
little party closed the door of their home behind
them, and took up their line of march to the rendezvous.</p>
<p>The shortest way to Battles&#8217;s was by a ford
farther down the river, and not by the way of the
Younkins place. So, crossing the creek on a fallen
tree near where Sandy had shot his famous flock
of ducks, and then steering straight across the flat
bottom-land on the opposite side, the party struck
into a trail that led through the cottonwoods
skirting the west bank of the stream. The moon
was full, and the darkness of the grove through
which they wended their way in single file was
lighted by long shafts of moonbeams that streamed
through the dense growth. The silence, save for
the steady tramp of the little expedition, was absolute.
Now and again a night-owl hooted, or a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
sleeping hare, scared from its form, scampered
away into the underbrush; but these few sounds
made the solitude only more oppressive. Charlie,
bringing up the rear, noted the glint of the moonlight
on the barrels of the firearms carried by the
party ahead of him, and all the romance in his
nature was kindled by the thought that this was
frontier life in the Indian country. Not far away,
he thought, as he turned his face to the southward,
the cabins of settlers along the Smoky Hill were
burning, and death and desolation marked the
trail of the cruel Cheyennes.</p>
<p>Now and again Sandy, shivering in the chill
and dampness of the wood, fell back and whispered
to Oscar, who followed him in the narrow trail,
that this would be awfully jolly if he were not so
sleepy. The lad was accustomed to go to bed
soon after dark; it was now late into the night.</p>
<p>All hands were glad when the big double cabin
of the Battles family came in sight about midnight,
conspicuous on a rise of the rolling prairie and
black against the sky. Lights were burning
brightly in one end of the cabin; in the other end
a part of the company had gone to sleep, camping
on the floor. Hot coffee and corn-bread were
ready for the newcomers, and Younkins, with a
tender regard for the lads, who were unaccustomed
to milk when at home, brought out a big
pan of delicious cool milk for their refreshment.
Altogether, as Sandy confessed to himself, an Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
scare was not without its fun. He listened
with great interest to the tales that the settlers
had to tell of the exploits of Gray Wolf, the
leader and chief of the Cheyennes. He was a
famous man in his time, and some of the elder
settlers of Kansas will even now remember his
name with awe. The boys were not at all desirous
of meeting the Indian foe, but they secretly hoped
that if they met any of the redskins, they would
see the far-famed Gray Wolf.</p>
<p>While the party, refreshed by their late supper,
found a lodging anywhere on the floor of the
cabin, a watch was set outside, for the Indians
might pounce upon them at any hour of the night
or day. Those who had mounted guard during
the earlier part of the evening went to their rest.
Charlie, as he dropped off to sleep, heard the footsteps
of the sentry outside and said to himself, half
in jest, &#8220;The Wolf is at the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no wolf came to disturb their slumbers.
The bright and cheerful day, and the song of birds
dispelled the gloom of the night, and fear was
lifted from the minds of the anxious settlers, some
of whom, separated from wives and children, were
troubled with thoughts of homes despoiled and
crops destroyed. Just as they had finished breakfast
and were preparing for the march to the fort,
now only two or three miles away, a mounted man
in the uniform of a United States dragoon dashed
up to the cabin, and, with a flourish of soldierly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
manner, informed the company that the commanding
officer at the post had information that the
Cheyennes, instead of crossing over to the Republican
as had been expected, or attacking the fort,
had turned and gone back the way they came.
All was safe, and the settlers might go home
assured that there was no danger to themselves
or their families.</p>
<p>Having delivered this welcome message in a
grand and semi-official manner, the corporal dismounted
from his steed, in answer to a pressing
invitation from Battles, and unbent himself like
an ordinary mortal to partake of a very hearty
breakfast of venison, corn-bread, and coffee. The
company unslung their guns and rifles, sat down
again, and regaled themselves with pipes, occasional
cups of strong coffee, and yet more exhilarating
tales of the exploits and adventures of
Indian slayers of the earlier time on the Kansas
frontier. The great Indian scare was over. Before
night fell again, every settler had gone his
own way to his claim, glad that things were no
worse, but groaning at Uncle Sam for the niggardliness
which had left the region so defenceless
when an emergency had come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>DISCOURAGEMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Right glad were our settlers to see their log-cabin
home peacefully sleeping in the autumnal
sunshine, as they returned along the familiar trail
from the river. They had gone back by the way
of the Younkins place and had partaken of the
good man&#8217;s hospitality. Younkins thought it best
to leave his brood with his neighbors on the Big
Blue for another day. &#8220;The old woman,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;would feel sort of scary-like&#8221; until things had
well blown over. She was all right where she
was, and he would try to get on alone for a while.
So the boys, under his guidance, cooked a hearty
luncheon which they heartily enjoyed. Younkins
had milk and eggs, both of which articles were
luxuries to the Whittier boys, for on their ranch
they had neither cow nor hens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we have some hens this fall,
daddy?&#8221; asked Sandy, luxuriating in a big bowl
of custard sweetened with brown sugar, which the
skilful Charlie had compounded. &#8220;We can build
a hen-house there by the corral, under the lee of
the cabin, and make it nice and warm for the winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Battles has got hens to sell, and perhaps Mr.
Younkins would be willing to sell us some of his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we stay, Sandy, we will have some fowls; but
we will talk about that by and by,&#8221; said his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay?&#8221; echoed Sandy. &#8220;Why, is there any
notion of going back? Back from &#8216;bleeding Kansas&#8217;?
Why, daddy, I&#8217;m ashamed of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Howell smiled and looked at his brother-in-law.
&#8220;Things do not look very encouraging for a
winter in Kansas, bleeding or not bleeding; do
they, Charlie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you appeal to me, father,&#8221; replied
the lad, &#8220;I shall be glad to stay and glad to go
home. But, after all, I must say, I don&#8217;t exactly
see what we can do here this winter. There is no
farm work that can be done. But it would cost
an awful lot of money to go back to Dixon, unless
we took back everything with us and went as we
came. Wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Younkins did not say anything, but he looked
approvingly at Charlie while the other two men
discussed the problem. Mr. Bryant said it was
likely to be a hard winter; they had no corn to
sell, none to feed to their cattle. &#8220;But corn is so
cheap that the settlers over on Solomon&#8217;s Fork say
they will use it for fuel this winter. Battles told
me so. I&#8217;d like to see a fire of corn on the cob;
they say it makes a hot fire burned that way.
Corn-cobs without corn hold the heat a long time.
I&#8217;ve tried it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is just here, boys,&#8221; said Uncle Aleck. &#8220;The
folks at home are lonesome; they write, you know,
that they want to come out before the winter sets
in. But it would be mighty hard for women out
here, this coming winter, with big hulking fellows
like us to cook for and with nothing for us to do.
Everything to eat would have to be bought. We
haven&#8217;t even an ear of corn for ourselves or our
cattle. Instead of selling corn at the post, as we
expected, we would have to buy of our neighbors,
Mr. Younkins here, and Mr. Fuller, and we would be
obliged to buy our flour and groceries at the post,
or down at Manhattan; and they charge two prices
for things out here; they have to, for it costs
money to haul stuff all the way from the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Younkins, resignedly. He was
thinking of making a trip to &#8220;the river,&#8221; as the
settlers around there always called the Missouri,
one hundred and fifty miles distant. But Younkins
assured his friends that they were welcome to
live in his cabin where they still were at home, for
another year, if they liked, and he would haul
from the river any purchases that they might
make. He was expecting to be ready to start for
Leavenworth in a few days, as they knew, and one
of them could go down with him and lay in a few
supplies. His team could haul enough for all
hands. If not, they could double up the two
teams and bring back half of Leavenworth, if
they had the money to buy so much. He &#8220;hated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
dreadfully&#8221; to hear them talking about going
back to Illinois.</p>
<p>But when the settlers reached home and found
amusement and some little excitement in the digging
up of their household treasures and putting
things in place once more, the thought of leaving
this home in the Far West obtruded itself rather
unpleasantly on the minds of all of them, although
nobody spoke of what each thought. Oscar had
hidden his precious violin high up among the
rafters of the cabin, being willing to lose it only if
the cabin were burned. There was absolutely no
other place where it would be safe to leave it. He
climbed to the loft overhead and brought it forth
with great glee, laid his cheek lovingly on its body
and played a familiar air. Engrossed in his music,
he played on and on until he ran into the melody
of &#8220;Home, Sweet Home,&#8221; to which he had added
many curious and artistic variations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t play that, Oscar; you make me homesick!&#8221;
cried Charlie, with a suspicious moisture
in his eyes. &#8220;It was all very well for us to hear
that when this was the only home we had or expected
to have; but daddy and Uncle Charlie
have set us to thinking about the home in Illinois,
and that will make us all homesick, I really
believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is all my &#8216;funny business&#8217; wasted,&#8221; cried
Sandy. &#8220;No Indian came to read my comic letter,
after all. I suppose the mice and crickets must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
have found some amusement in it; I saw any
number of them scampering away when I opened
the door; but I guess they are the only living
things that have been here since we went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it queer that we should be gone like this
for nearly two days,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;leaving everything
behind us, and come back and know that
nobody has been any nearer to the place than we
have, all the time? I can&#8217;t get used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My little philosopher,&#8221; said his Uncle Charlie,
&#8220;we are living in the wilderness; and if you were
to live here always, you would feel, by and by,
that every newcomer was an interloper; you
would resent the intrusion of any more settlers
here, interfering with our freedom and turning
out their cattle to graze on the ranges that seem
to be so like our own, now. That&#8217;s what happens
to frontier settlers, everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Sandy, &#8220;I s&#8217;pose we should all be
like that man over on the Big Blue that Mr. Fuller
tells about, who moved away when a newcomer
took up a claim ten miles and a half from him,
because, as he thought, the people were getting too
thick. For my part, I am willing to have this
part of Kansas crowded to within, say, a mile and
a half of us, and no more. Hey, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the prospect of that side of the Republican
Fork being over-full with settlers did not seem very
imminent about that time. From parts of Kansas
nearer to the Missouri River than they were, they
heard of a slackening in the stream of migration.
The prospect of a cold winter had cooled the ardor
of the politicians who had determined, earlier in
the season, to hold the Territory against all comers.
Something like a truce had been tacitly agreed on,
and there was a cessation of hostilities for the present.
The troops had been marched back from
Lawrence to the post, and no more elections were
coming on for the present in any part of the Territory.
Mr. Bryant, who was the only ardent politician
of the company, thought that it would be a
good plan to go back to Illinois for the winter.
They could come out again in the spring and bring
the rest of the two families with them. The land
would not run away while they were gone.</p>
<p>It was with much reluctance that the boys accepted
this plan of their elders. They were especially
sorry that it was thought best that the two
men should stay behind and wind up affairs, while
the three lads would go down to the river with
Younkins, and thence home by steamer from
Leavenworth down the Missouri to St. Louis.
But, after a few days of debate, this was thought
to be the best thing that could be done. It was
on a dull, dark November day that the boys, wading
for the last time the cold stream of the Fork,
crossed over to Younkins&#8217;s early in the morning,
while the sky was red with the dawning, carrying
their light baggage with them. They had ferried
their trunks across the day before, using the oxcart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
for the purpose and loading all into Younkins&#8217;s
team, ready for the homeward journey.</p>
<p>Now that the bustle of departure had come, it
did not seem so hard to leave the new home on the
Republican as they had expected. It had been
agreed that the two men should follow in a week,
in time to take the last steamboat going down the
river in the fall, from Fort Benton, before the closing
of navigation for the season. Mr. Bryant, unknown
to the boys, had written home to Dixon
directing that money be sent in a letter addressed
to Charlie, in care of a well-known firm in Leavenworth.
They would find it there on their arrival,
and that would enable them to pay their way down
the river to St. Louis and thence home by the railroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose the money shouldn&#8217;t turn up?&#8221;
asked Charlie, when told of the money awaiting
them. He was accustomed to look on the dark
side of things, sometimes, so the rest of them
thought. &#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you will have to walk home,&#8221;
said his uncle, with a smile. &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry
about that. At the worst, you can work your
passage to St. Louis, and there you will find
your uncle, Oscar G. Bryant, of the firm of
Bryant, Wilder &amp; Co. I&#8217;ll give you his address,
and he will see you through, in case of accidents.
But there will be no accidents. What is the use
of borrowing trouble about that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>They did not borrow any trouble, and as they
drove away from the scenes that had grown so
familiar to them, they looked forward, as all boys
would, to an adventurous voyage down the Missouri,
and a welcome home to their mothers and
their friends in dear old Dixon.</p>
<p>The nights were now cold and the days chilly.
They had cooked a goodly supply of provisions
for their journey, for they had not much ready
money to pay for fare by the way. At noon they
stopped by the roadside and made a pot of hot
coffee, opened their stores of provisions and
lunched merrily, gypsy-fashion, caring nothing for
the curious looks and inquisitive questions of
other wayfarers who passed them. For the first
few nights they attempted to sleep in the wagon.
But it was fearfully cold, and the wagon-bed,
cluttered up with trunks, guns, and other things,
gave them very little room. Miserable and sore,
they resolved to spend their very last dollar, if
need be, in paying for lodging at the wayside inns
and hospitable cabins of the settlers along the
road. The journey homeward was not nearly so
merry as that of the outward trip. But new cabins
had been built along their route, and the lads
found much amusement in hunting up their former
camping-places as they drove along the military
road to Fort Leavenworth.</p>
<p>In this way, sleeping at the farm-houses and
such casual taverns as had grown up by the highway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
and usually getting their supper and breakfast
where they slept, they crept slowly toward
the river. Sandy was the cashier of the party,
although he had preferred that Charlie, being the
eldest, should carry their slender supply of cash.
Charlie would not take that responsibility; but,
as the days went by, he rigorously required an
accounting every morning; he was very much
afraid that their money would not hold out until
they reached Leavenworth.</p>
<p>Twenty miles a day with an ox-team was fairly
good travelling; and it was one hundred and fifty
miles from the Republican to the Missouri, as the
young emigrants travelled the road. A whole
week had been consumed by the tedious trip when
they drove into the busy and bustling town of
Leavenworth, one bright autumnal morning. All
along the way they had picked up much information
about the movement of steamers, and they
were delighted to find that the steamboat &#8220;New
Lucy&#8221; was lying at the levee, ready to sail on the
afternoon of the very day they would be in Leavenworth.
They camped, for the last time, in the
outskirts of the town, a good-natured border-State
man affording them shelter in his hay-barn, where
they slept soundly all through their last night in
&#8220;bleeding Kansas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;New Lucy,&#8221; from Fort Benton on the
upper Missouri, was blowing off steam as they
drove down to the levee. Younkins helped them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
unload their baggage, wrung their hands, one
after another, with real tears in his eyes, for he
had learned to love these hearty, happy lads, and
then drove away with his cattle to pen them for
the day and night that he should be there. Charlie
and Oscar went to the warehouse of Osterhaus &amp;
Wickham, where they were to find the letter from
home, the precious letter containing forty dollars
to pay their expenses homeward.</p>
<p>Sandy sat on the pile of trunks watching with
great interest the novel sight of hurrying passengers,
different from any people he ever saw
before; black &#8220;roustabouts,&#8221; or deck-hands, tumbling
the cargo and the firewood on board, singing,
shouting, and laughing the while, the white mates
overseeing the work with many hard words, and
the captain, tough and swarthy, superintending
from the upper deck the mates and all hands. A
party of nice-looking, citified people, as Sandy
thought them, attracted his attention on the upper
deck, and he mentally wondered what they could
be doing here, so far in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Car&#8217; yer baggage aboard, boss?&#8221; asked a lively
young negro, half-clad and hungry-looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not yet,&#8221; answered Sandy, feeling in his
trousers pocket the last two quarters of a dollar
that was left them. &#8220;Not yet. I am not ready to go
aboard till my mates come.&#8221; The hungry-looking
darky made a rush for another more promising
passenger and left Sandy lounging where the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
lads soon after found him. Charlie&#8217;s face was a
picture of despair. Oscar looked very grave, for
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; cried Sandy, starting from his
seat. &#8220;Have you seen a ghost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s
stolen the money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stolen the money?&#8221; echoed Sandy, with vague
terror, the whole extent of the catastrophe flitting
before his mind. &#8220;Why, what on earth do you
mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar explained that they had found the letter,
as they expected, and he produced it, written by
the two loving mothers at home. They said that
they had made up their minds to send fifty dollars,
instead of the forty that Uncle Charlie had said
would be enough. It was in ten-dollar notes, five
of them; at least, it had been so when the letter
left Dixon. When it was opened in Leavenworth,
it was empty, save for the love and tenderness
that were in it. Sandy groaned.</p>
<p>The lively young darky came up again with,
&#8220;Car&#8217; yer baggage aboard, boss?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was sickening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to be done now?&#8221; said Charlie, in
deepest dejection, as he sat on the pile of baggage
that now looked so useless and needless. &#8220;I just
believe some of the scamps I saw loafing around
there in that store stole the money out of the letter.
See here; it was sealed with that confounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
new-fangled &#8216;mucilage&#8217;; gumstickum I call it.
Anybody could feel those five bank-notes inside of
the letter, and anybody could steam it open, take
out the money, and seal it up again. We have
been robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see the heads of the house there
at Osterhaus &amp; Wickham&#8217;s. They will see us
righted,&#8221; cried Sandy, indignantly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
stand it, for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; groaned Charlie. &#8220;We saw Mr. Osterhaus.
He was very sorry&ndash;&ndash;oh, yes!&ndash;&ndash;awfully
sorry; but he didn&#8217;t know us, and he had
no responsibility for the letters that came to his
place. It was only an accommodation to people
that he took them in his care, anyhow. Oh, it&#8217;s no
use talking! Here we are, stranded in a strange
place, knowing no living soul in the whole town
but good old Younkins, and nobody knows where
he is. He couldn&#8217;t lend us the money, even
if we were mean enough to ask him. Good old
Younkins!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Younkins!&#8221; cried Sandy, starting to his feet.
&#8220;He will give us good advice. He has got a great
head, has Younkins. I&#8217;ll go and ask him what to
do. Bless me! There he is now!&#8221; and as he
spoke, the familiar slouching figure of their neighbor
came around the corner of a warehouse on the
levee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t yer go aboard, boys? The boat
leaves at noon, and it&#8217;s past twelve now. I just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
thought I&#8217;d come down and say good-by-like, for
I&#8217;m powerful sorry to have ye go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys explained to the astonished and
grieved Younkins how they had been wrecked,
as it were, almost in sight of the home port. The
good man nodded his head gravely, as he listened,
softly jingled the few gold coins in his trousers
pocket, and said: &#8220;Well, boys, this is the wust
scald I ever did see. If I wasn&#8217;t so dreadful hard
up, I&#8217;d give ye what I&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to be thought of, Mr. Younkins,&#8221;
said Charlie, with dignity and gratitude, &#8220;for we
can&#8217;t think of borrowing money to get home with.
It would be better to wait until we can write home
for more. We might earn enough to pay our
board.&#8221; And Charlie, with a sigh, looked around
at the unsympathetic and hurrying throng.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got baggage as security for your passage
to St. Louis. Go aboard and tell the clerk
how you are fixed. Your pa said as how you
would be all right when you got to St. Louis. Go
and &#8217;brace&#8217; the clerk.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a new idea to the boys. They had
never heard of such a thing. Who would dare
to ask such a great favor? The fare from Leavenworth
to St. Louis was twelve dollars each.
They had known all about that. And they knew,
too, that the price included their meals on the way
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go brace the clerk,&#8221; said Sandy, stoutly;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
and before the others could put in a word, he was
gone.</p>
<p>The clerk was a handsome, stylish-looking man,
with a good-natured countenance that reassured
the timid boy at once. Mustering up his waning
courage, Sandy stated the case to him, telling him
that that pile of trunks and guns on the levee was
theirs, and that they would leave them on board
when they got to St. Louis until they had found
their uncle and secured the money for their fares.</p>
<p>The handsome clerk looked sharply at the lad
while he was telling his story. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got an
honest face, my little man. I&#8217;ll trust you. Bring
aboard your baggage. People spar their way on
the river every day in the year; you needn&#8217;t be
ashamed of it. Accidents will happen, you know.&#8221;
And the busy clerk turned away to another customer.</p>
<p>With a light heart Sandy ran ashore. His waiting
and anxiously watching comrades saw by his
face that he had been successful, before he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all fixed,&#8221; he cried, blithely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully boy!&#8221; said Younkins, admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Car&#8217; yer baggage aboard, boss?&#8221; asked the
lively young darky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it along,&#8221; said Sandy, with a lordly air.
They shook hands with Younkins once more, this
time with more fervor than ever. Then the three
lads filed on board the steamboat. The gang-plank
was hauled in, put out again for the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
tardy passenger, once more taken aboard, and then
the stanch steamer &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; was on her way
down the turbid Missouri.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Sandy,&#8221; whispered Charlie, &#8220;you gave that
darky almost the last cent we had for bringing
our baggage on board. We ought to have lugged
it aboard ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lugged it aboard ourselves? And all these
people that we are going to be passengers with for
the next four or five days watching us while we
did a roustabout&#8217;s work? Not much. We&#8217;ve a
quarter left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie was silent. The great stern-wheel of
the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; revolved with a dashing and a
churning sound. The yellow banks of the Missouri
sped by them. The sacred soil of Kansas
slid past as in a swiftly moving panorama. One
home was hourly growing nearer, while another
was fading away there into the golden autumnal
distance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>DOWN THE BIG MUDDY.</h3>
</div>
<p>It is more than six hundred miles from Leavenworth
to St. Louis by the river. And as the river
is crooked exceedingly, a steamboat travelling
that route points her bow at every point of the
compass, north, south, east, and west, before the
voyage is finished. The boys were impatient to
reach home, to be back in dear old Dixon, to see
the mother and the fireside once more. But they
knew that days must pass before they could reach
St. Louis. The three lads settled themselves comfortably
in the narrow limits of their little stateroom;
for they found that their passage included
quarters really more luxurious than they had been
accustomed to in their Kansas log-cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much army blanket and buffalo-robe about
this,&#8221; whispered Oscar, pressing his toil-stained
hand on the nice white spread of his berth. &#8220;Say,
wouldn&#8217;t Younkins allow that this was rather
comfortable-like, if he was to see it and compare it
with his deerskin coverlet that he is so proud of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Younkins&#8217;s deerskin coverlet is paid for,
and this isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Charlie, grimly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>But the light-hearted younger boys borrowed
no trouble on that score. As Sandy said, laughingly,
they were all fixed for the trip to St. Louis,
and what was the use of fretting about the passage
money until the time came to pay it?</p>
<p>When the lads, having exchanged their flannel
shirts for white cotton ones, saved up for this
occasion, came out from their room, they saw two
long tables covered with snowy cloths set for the
whole length of the big saloon. They had scanned
the list of meal hours hanging in their stateroom,
and were very well satisfied to find that there
were three meals served each day. It was nearly
time for the two o&#8217;clock dinner, and the colored
servants were making ready the tables. The boat
was crowded with passengers, and it looked as if
some of them would be obliged to wait for the
&#8220;second table.&#8221; On board of a steamboat, especially
in those days of long voyages, the matter of
getting early to the table and having a good seat
was of great concern to the passengers. Men
stood around, lining the walls of the saloon and
regarding with hungry expectation the movements
of the waiters who were making ready the tables.
When the chairs were placed, every man laid his
hand on the top of the seat nearest him, prepared,
as one of the boys privately expressed it, to &#8220;make
a grab.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if we don&#8217;t make a grab, too, we shall
get left,&#8221; whispered Sandy, and the boys bashfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
filed down the saloon and stood ready to take their
seats when the gong should sound.</p>
<p>To eyes unused to the profuseness of living that
then prevailed on the best class of Western steamboats,
the display on the dining-tables of the &#8220;New
Lucy&#8221; was very grand indeed. The waiters, all
their movements regulated by something like military
discipline, filed in and out bearing handsome
dishes for the decoration of the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at those gorgeous flowers! Red,
white, blue, purple, yellow! My! aren&#8217;t they
fine?&#8221; said Sandy, under his breath.</p>
<p>Oscar giggled. &#8220;They are artificial, Sandy.
How awfully green you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy stoutly maintained that they were real
flowers. He could smell them. But when one
of the waiters, having accidentally overturned one
of the vases and knocked a flaming bouquet on
the carpeted floor of the cabin, snatched it up and
dusted it with his big black hand, Sandy gave in,
and murmured, &#8220;Tis true; they&#8217;re false.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the boys&#8217; eyes fairly stood out with wonder
and admiration when a procession of colored men
came out of the pantry, bearing a grand array of
ornamental dishes. Pineapples, bananas, great baskets
of fancy cakes, and other dainties attracted
their wonder-stricken gaze. But most of all, numerous
pyramids of macaroons, two or three feet
high, with silky veils of spun sugar falling down
from summit to base, fascinated their attention.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
They had never seen the like at a public table;
and the generous board of the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; fairly
groaned with good things when the gong somewhat
superfluously announced to the waiting
throng that dinner was served.</p>
<p>&#8220;No plates, knives, or forks,&#8221; said Sandy, as,
amid a great clatter and rush, everybody sat down
to the table. Just then a long procession of colored
waiters emerged from the pantry, the foremost man
carrying a pile of plates, and after him came another
with a basket of knives, after him another with a
basket of forks, then another with spoons, and so on,
each man carrying a supply of some one article for
the table. With the same military precision that
had marked all their movements, six black hands
were stretched at the same instant over the shoulders
of the sitting passengers, and six articles
were noiselessly dropped on the table; then, with
a similar motion, the six black hands went back to
their respective owners, as the procession moved
along behind the guests, the white-sleeved arms
and black hands waving in the air and keeping
exact time as the procession moved around the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a white-legged centipede,&#8221; muttered
Sandy, under his breath. But more evolutions
were coming. These preliminaries having been
finished, the solemn procession went back to the
kitchen regions, and presently came forth again,
bearing a glittering array of shining metal covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
dishes. At the tap of the pompous head-waiter&#8217;s
bell, every man stood at &#8220;present arms,&#8221; as Oscar
said. Then, at another tap, each dish was projected
over the white cloth to the spot for which it was
designed, and held an inch or two above the table.
Another tap, and every dish dropped into its place
with a sound as of one soft blow. The pompous
head-waiter struck his bell again, and every dish-cover
was touched by a black hand. One more
jingle, and, with magical swiftness and deftness,
each dish-cover was lifted, and a delightful perfume
of savory viands gushed forth amidst the
half-suppressed &#8220;Ahs&#8221; of the assembled and hungry
diners. Then the procession of dark-skinned
waiters, bearing the dish-covers, filed back to the
pantry, and the real business of the day began.
This was the way that dinners were served on all
the first-rate steamboats on Western rivers in those
days.</p>
<p>To hungry, hearty boys, used of late to the
rough fare of the frontier, and just from a hard
trip in an ox-wagon, with very short rations indeed,
this profusion of good things was a real delight.
Sandy&#8217;s mouth watered, but he gently sighed to
himself, &#8220;&#8217;Most takes away my appetite.&#8221; The
polite, even servile, waiters pressed the lads with
the best of everything on the generous board;
and Sandy&#8217;s cup of happiness was full when a
jolly darky, his ebony face shining with good-nature,
brought him some frosted cake, charlotte
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
russe, and spun sugar and macaroons from one of
the shattered pyramids.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;ye s&#8217;pose they break those up every day?&#8221;
whispered Sandy to the more dignified Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suttinly, suh,&#8221; replied the colored man, overhearing
the question; &#8220;suttinly, suh. Dis yere
boat is de fastest and de finest on de Big Muddy,
young gent; an&#8217; dere&#8217;s nuttin&#8217; in dis yere worl&#8217;
that the &#8216;New Lucy&#8217; doan have on her table; an&#8217;
doan yer fergit it, young mas&#8217;r,&#8221; he added, with
respectful pride in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! what a tuck-out! I&#8217;ve ate and ate until
I&#8217;m fairly fit to bust,&#8221; said Sandy, as the three
boys, their dinner over, sauntered out into the
open air and beheld the banks of the river swiftly
slipping by as they glided down the stream.</p>
<p>Just then, glancing around, his eye caught the
amused smile of a tall and lovely lady who was
standing near by, chatting with two or three rather
superior-looking young people whom the lad had
first noticed when the question of having the baggage
brought on board at Leavenworth was under
discussion. Sandy&#8217;s brown cheek flushed; but the
pretty lady, extending her hand, said: &#8220;Pardon
my smiling, my boy; but I have a dear lad at
home in Baltimore who always says just that after
his Christmas dinner, and sometimes on other
occasions, perhaps; and his name is Sandy, too.
I think I heard your brother call you Sandy?
This is your brother, is it not?&#8221; And the lady
turned towards Charlie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>The lad explained the relationship of the little
party, and the lady from Baltimore introduced the
members of her party. They had been far up the
river to Fort Benton, where they had spent some
weeks with friends who were in the military garrison
at that post. The young men, of whom
there were three in the party, had been out hunting
for buffalo, elk, and other big game. Had the
boys ever killed any buffalo? The pleasant-faced
young gentleman who asked the question had
noticed that they had a full supply of guns when
they came aboard at Leavenworth.</p>
<p>Yes, they had killed buffalo; at least, Sandy had;
and the youngster&#8217;s exploit on the bluff of the
Republican Fork was glowingly narrated by the
generous and manly Charlie. This story broke
the ice with the newly met voyagers and, before
the gong sounded for supper, the Whittier boys,
as they still called themselves, were quite as well
acquainted with the party from Baltimore, as they
thought, as they would have been if they had
been neighbors and friends on the banks of the
Republican.</p>
<p>The boys looked in at the supper-table. They
only looked; for although the short autumnal
afternoon had fled swiftly by while they were chatting
with their new friends or exploring the steamboat,
they felt that they could not possibly take
another repast so soon after their first real &#8220;tuck-out&#8221;
on the &#8220;New Lucy.&#8221; The overloaded table,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
shining with handsome glass and china and decked
with fancy cakes, preserves, and sweetmeats, had
no present attractions for the boys. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like
after Thanksgiving dinner,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;Only
we are far from home,&#8221; he added, rather soberly.
And when the lads crawled into their bunks, as
Sandy insisted upon calling their berths, it would
not surprise one if &#8220;thoughts of home and sighs
disturbed the sleeper&#8217;s long-drawn breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time and again, in the night-watches, the
steamer stopped at some landing by the river-side.
Now it would be a mere wood-pile, and the boat
would be moored to a cottonwood tree that overhung
the stream. Torches of light-wood burning
in iron frames at the end of a staff stuck into the
ground or lashed to the steamer rail shed a wild,
weird glare on the hurrying scene as the roustabouts,
or deck-hands, nimbly lugged the wood on
board, or carried the cargo ashore, singing plaintive
melodies as they worked. Then again, the steamer
would be made fast to a wharf-boat by some small
town, or to the levee of a larger landing-place,
and goods went ashore, passengers flitted on and
off, baggage was transferred, the gang-plank was
hauled in with prodigious clatter, the engineer&#8217;s
bell tinkled, and, with a great snort from her
engines, the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; resumed her way down
the river. Few passengers but those who were to
go ashore could be seen on the upper deck viewing
the strange sights of making a night-landing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
And through the whole racket and din, three lads
slept the sleep of the young and the innocent in
room Number 56. &#8220;Just the number of the year
with the eighteen knocked off,&#8221; Sandy had said
when they were assigned to it.</p>
<p>When the boys had asked in Leavenworth how
long the trip to St. Louis would be, they were told,
&#8220;Three or four days, if the water holds.&#8221; This
they thought rather vague information, and they
had only a dim idea of what the man meant by the
water holding. They soon learned. The season
had been dry for the time of year. Although it
was now November, little or no autumnal rains
had fallen. Passengers from Fort Benton said
that the lands on the Upper Missouri were parched
for want of water, and the sluggish currents of the
Big Muddy were &#8220;as slow as cold molasses,&#8221; as
one of the deck-hands said to Sandy, when he was
peering about the lower deck of the steamboat.
It began to look as if the water would not hold.</p>
<p>On the second afternoon out of Leavenworth,
as the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; was gallantly sweeping around
Prairie Bend, where any boat going down stream
is headed almost due north, the turn in the river
revealed no less than four other steamers hard and
fast on the shoals that now plentifully appeared
above the surface of the yellow water. Cautiously
feeling her way along through these treacherous
bars and sands, the &#8220;New Lucy,&#8221; with slackened
speed, moved bravely down upon the stranded fleet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Anxious passengers clustered on the forward part
of the steamer, watching the course of events.
With many a cough and many a sigh, the boat
swung to the right or left, obedient to her helm,
the cry of the man heaving the lead for soundings
telling them how fast the water shoaled or deepened
as they moved down stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are bound to get aground,&#8221; said Oscar, as
he scanned the wide river, apparently almost bare
to its bed. &#8220;I suppose there is a channel, and
I suppose that pilot up there in the pilot-house
knows where it is, but I don&#8217;t see any.&#8221; Just
then the water before them suddenly shoaled, there
was a soft, grating sound, a thud, and the boat
stopped, hard and fast aground. The &#8220;New Lucy&#8221;
had joined the fleet of belated steamers on the
shoals of Prairie Bend.</p>
<p>The order was given for all passengers to go aft;
and while the lads were wondering what they were
so peremptorily sent astern for, they saw two tall
spars that had been carried upright at the bow of
the boat rigged into the shape of a V upside down,
and set on either side of the craft, the lower ends
resting on the sand-bar each side of her. A big
block and tackle were rigged at the point where
the spars crossed each other over the bow of the
boat, and from these a stout cable was made fast
to the steamer&#8217;s &#8220;nose,&#8221; as the boys heard somebody
call the extreme point of the bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are actually going to hoist this boat over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the sand-bar,&#8221; said Sandy, excitedly, as they viewed
these preparations from the rear of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is exactly what they are going to do,&#8221;
said the pleasant-faced young man from Baltimore.
&#8220;Now, then!&#8221; he added, with the air of one encouraging
another, as the crew, laying hold of the
tackle, and singing with a queer, jerky way, began
to hoist. This would not avail. The nose of the
boat was jammed deep into the sand, and so the
cable was led back to a windlass, around which it
was carried. Then, the windlass being worked by
steam, the hull of the steamer rose very slightly,
and the bottom of the bow was released from the
river-bottom. The pilot rang his bell, the engine
puffed and clattered, and the boat crept ahead for
a few feet, and then came to rest again. That was
all that could be done until the spars were reset
further forward or deep water was reached. It
was discouraging, for with all their pulling and
hauling, that had lasted for more than an hour,
they had made only four or five feet of headway.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the rate of five feet an hour, how long will
it take us to spar our way down to St. Louis?&#8221;
asked Charlie, quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Charlie,&#8221; cried Sandy, &#8220;I know now why
the clerk said that there were plenty of fellows
who had to spar their way on the river. It is hard
work to pull this steamer over the sand-bars and
shoals, and when a man is busted and has to work
his way along, he&#8217;s like a steamboat in a fix, like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
this one is. See? That&#8217;s the reason why they
say he is sparring his way, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite correct, youngster,&#8221; said the
young man from Baltimore, regarding Sandy&#8217;s
bright face with pleasure. &#8220;Correct you are. But
I never knew what the slang meant until I came
out here. And, for that matter, I don&#8217;t know that
I ever heard the slang before. But it is the jargon
of the river men.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time, even sparring was of very little
use, for the spars only sank deep and deeper into
the soft river-bottom, and there was no chance to
raise the bow of the boat from its oozy bed. The
case for the present was hopeless; but the crew
were kept constantly busy until nightfall, pulling
and hauling. Some were sent ashore in a skiff,
with a big hawser, which was made fast to a tree,
and then all the power of the boat, men and steam,
was put upon it to twist her nose off from the
shoal into which it was stuck. All sorts of devices
were resorted to, and a small gain was made once
in a while; but it looked very much as if the calculation
of Charlie, five feet in an hour, was too
liberal an allowance for the progress towards St.
Louis.</p>
<p>Just then, from the boat furthest down the river
rose a cloud of steam, and the astonished lads
heard a most extraordinary sound like that of a
gigantic organ. More or less wheezy, but still
easily to be understood, the well-known notes of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
&#8220;Oh, Susannah!&#8221; came floating up the river to
them. Everybody paused to listen, even the tired
and tugging roustabouts smiling at the unwonted
music.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really music?&#8221; asked Oscar, whose artistic
ear was somewhat offended by this strange roar
of sounds. The young man from Baltimore assured
him that this was called music; the music of a
steam-organ or calliope, then a new invention on
the Western rivers. He explained that it was an
instrument made of a series of steam-whistles so
arranged that a man, sitting where he could handle
them all very rapidly, could play a tune on them.
The player had only to know the key to which
each whistle was pitched, and, with a simple arrangement
of notes before him, he could make a
gigantic melody that could be heard for many
miles away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a musician, are you not?&#8221; asked the
young man from Baltimore. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I hear you
playing a violin in your room last night? Or was
it one of your brothers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar, having blushingly acknowledged that he
was playing his violin for the benefit of his cousins,
as he explained, his new-found acquaintance said,
&#8220;I play the flute a little, and we might try some
pieces together some time, if you are willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they were making ready for bed that night,
the pleasant-faced young man from Baltimore, who
had been playing whist with his mother and sister,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
and the &#8220;military man,&#8221; as the boys had privately
named one of the party, came to their door with
his flute. The two musicians were fast friends at
once. Flute and violin made delicious harmony,
in the midst of which Sandy, who had slipped into
his bunk, drifted off into the land of dreams with
confused notions of a giant band somewhere up
in the sky playing &#8220;Oh, Susannah!&#8221; &#8220;Love&#8217;s Last
Greeting,&#8221; and &#8220;How Can I Leave Thee?&#8221; with
occasional suggestions of the &#8220;Song of the Kansas
Emigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another morning came on, cold, damp, and raw.
The sky was overcast and there were signs of rain.
&#8220;There&#8217;s been rain to the nor&#8217;rard,&#8221; said Captain
Bulger, meditatively. Now Captain Bulger was
the skipper of the &#8220;New Lucy,&#8221; and when he
said those oracular words, they were reported
about the steamboat, to the great comfort of all on
board. Still the five boats stuck on the shoals;
their crews were still hard at work at all the devices
that could be thought of for their liberation.
The &#8220;War Eagle&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;for they had found out the
name of the musical steamer far down stream&ndash;&ndash;enlivened
the tedious day with her occasional strains
of martial and popular music, if the steam-organ
could be called musical.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Oscar and the amiable young
man from Baltimore shut themselves in their stateroom
and played the flute and violin. The lovely
lady who had made Sandy&#8217;s acquaintance early in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
the voyage asked him if he could make one at a
game of whist. Sandy replied that he could play
&#8220;a very little.&#8221; The thought of playing cards
here on a steamboat, in public, as he said to himself,
was rather frightful. He was not sure if
his mother would like to have him do that. He
looked uneasily around to see what Charlie would
say about it. But Charlie was nowhere in sight.
He was wandering around, like an uneasy ghost,
watching for signs of the rising of the river, now
confidently predicted by the knowing ones among
the passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boys all play whist,&#8221; said the lady, kindly;
&#8220;but if you do not like to play, I will not urge
you. We lack one of making up a party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy had been told that he was an uncommonly
good player for one so young. He liked the game;
there would be no stakes, of course. With his
ready habit of making up his mind, he brightly
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll play if you like, but you must know that
I am only a youngster and not a first-rate player.&#8221;
So they sat down, the lovely lady from Baltimore
being Sandy&#8217;s partner, and the military gentleman
and the young daughter of the lady from Baltimore
being their opponents. Sandy had great
good luck. The very best cards fell to him continually,
and he thought he had never played so
well. He caught occasional strains of music from
room Number 56, and he was glad that Oscar was
enjoying himself. From time to time the lovely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
lady who was his partner smiled approvingly at
him, and once in a while, while the cards were
being dealt, she said, &#8220;How divinely those dear
boys are playing!&#8221;</p>
<p>The afternoon sped on delightfully, and Sandy&#8217;s
spirits rose. He thought it would be fine if the
&#8220;New Lucy&#8221; should stay stuck on a sand-bar for
days and days, and he should have such a good
game of whist, with the lovely lady from Baltimore
for a partner. But the military gentleman grew
tired. His luck was very poor, and when the servants
began to rattle dishes on the supper-table,
he suggested that it would be just as well perhaps
if they did not play too much now; they would
enjoy the game better later on. They agreed to
stop with the next game.</p>
<p>When they had first taken their places at the
card-table, the military gentleman had asked Sandy
if he had any cards, and when he replied that he
had none, the military gentleman, with a very
lordly air, sent one of the cabin waiters to the bar
for a pack of cards. Now that they were through
with the game, Sandy supposed that the military
gentleman would put the cards into his pocket and
pay for them. Instead of that he said, &#8220;Now, my
little man, we will saw off to see who shall pay
for the cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw off?&#8221; asked Sandy, faintly, with a dim
notion of what was meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my lad,&#8221; said the military gentleman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
&#8220;We will play one hand of Old Sledge to see who
shall pay for the cards and keep them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sinking heart, but with a brave face,
Sandy took up the cards dealt to him and began
to play. It was soon over. Sandy won one point
in the hand; the military gentleman had the other
three.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of your cards, my son,&#8221; said the
military gentleman; &#8220;we may want them again.
They charge the extravagant price of six bits for
them on this boat, and these will last us to St.
Louis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six bits! Seventy-five cents! And poor Sandy
had only twenty-five cents in his pocket. That
silver quarter represented the entire capital of the
Boy Settlers from Kansas. Looking up, he saw
Charlie regarding him with reproachful eyes from
a corner of the saloon. With great carefulness, he
gathered up his cards and rose, revolving in his
mind the awful problem of paying for seventy-five
cents&#8217; worth of cards with twenty-five cents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got yourself into a nice scrape,&#8221;
tragically whispered Charlie, in his ear, as soon as
the two boys were out of earshot of the others.
&#8220;What are you going to do now? You can spar
your way down to St. Louis, but you can&#8217;t spar
your way with that barkeeper for a pack of cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me alone, Charlie,&#8221; said Sandy, testily.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got to pay for these cards. I&#8217;ll
manage it somehow. Don&#8217;t you worry yourself
the least bit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Serves you right for gambling. What would
mother say if she knew it? If you hadn&#8217;t been so
ready to show off your whist-playing before these
strangers, you wouldn&#8217;t have got into such a box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t gamble,&#8221; replied Sandy, hotly. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t gambling to play a hand to see who shall pay
for the cards. All men do that. I have seen
daddy roll a game of tenpins to see who should
pay for the alley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for that. It is gambling to play
for the leastest thing as a stake. Nice fellow you
are, sitting down to play a hand of seven-up for
the price of a pack of cards! Six bits at that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice brotherly brother you are to nag me
about those confounded cards, instead of helping a
fellow out when he is down on his luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charlie, a little conscience-stricken, held his
peace, while Sandy broke away from him, and
rushed out into the chilly air of the after-deck.
There was no sympathy in the dark and murky
river, none in the forlorn shore, where rows of
straggling cottonwoods leaned over and swept
their muddy arms in the muddy water. Looking
around for a ray of hope, a bright idea struck him.
He could but try one chance. The bar of the &#8220;New
Lucy&#8221; was a very respectable-looking affair, as bars
go. It opened into the saloon cabin of the steamer
on its inner side, but in the rear was a small window
where the deck passengers sneaked up, from time
to time, and bought whatever they wanted, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
quietly slipped away again, unseen by the more
&#8220;high-toned&#8221; passengers in the cabin. Summoning
all his courage and assurance, the boy stepped
briskly to this outside opening, and, leaning his
arms jauntily on the window-ledge, said, &#8220;See
here, cap, I owe you for a pack of cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; replied the barkeeper, holding a bottle
between his eye and the light, and measuring its
contents.</p>
<p>This was not encouraging. Sandy, with a little
effort, went on: &#8220;You see we fellows, three of us,
are sparring our way down to St. Louis. We have
got trusted for our passage. We&#8217;ve friends in St.
Louis, and when we get there we shall be in funds.
Our luggage is in pawn for our passage money.
When we come down to get our luggage, I will
pay you the six bits I owe you for the cards. Is
that all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; said the barkeeper, and he set the bottle
down. As the lad went away from the window,
with a great load lifted from his heart, the barkeeper
put his head out of the opening, looked
after him, smiled, and said, &#8220;That boy&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Sandy joined his brother, who was wistfully
watching for him, he said, a little less boastfully
than might have been expected of him,
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Charlie. The barkeeper says
he will trust me until we get to St. Louis and
come aboard to get the luggage. He&#8217;s a good
fellow, even if he did say &#8216;yep&#8217; instead of &#8216;yes&#8217;
when I asked him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>In reply to Charlie&#8217;s eager questions, Sandy related
all that had happened, and Charlie, with
secret admiration for his small brother&#8217;s knack of
&#8220;cheeking it through,&#8221; as he expressed it, forbore
any further remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe the water is really rising!&#8221; exclaimed
the irrepressible youngster, who, now that
his latest trouble was fairly over, was already
thinking of something else. &#8220;Look at that log.
When I came out here just after breakfast, this
morning, it was high and dry on that shoal.
Now one end of it is afloat. See it bob up and
down?&#8221;</p>
<p>Full of the good news, the lads went hurriedly
forward to find Oscar, who, with his friend from
Baltimore, was regarding the darkening scene from
the other part of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s moving!&#8221; excitedly cried Oscar, pointing
his finger at the &#8220;War Eagle&#8221;; and, as he spoke,
that steamer slid slowly off the sand-bar, and with
her steam-organ playing triumphantly &#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t
you glad you&#8217;re out of the Wilderness!&#8221; a well-known
air in those days, she steamed steadily down
stream. From all the other boats, still stranded
though they were, loud cheers greeted the first to
be released from the long embargo. Presently
another, the &#8220;Thomas H. Benton,&#8221; slid off, and
churning the water with her wheels like a mad
thing, took her way down the river. All these
boats were flat-bottomed and, as the saying was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;could go anywhere if the ground was a little
damp.&#8221; A rise of a very few inches of water was
sufficient to float any one of them. And, in the
course of a half-hour, the &#8220;New Lucy,&#8221; to the
great joy of her passengers, with one more hoist on
her forward spars, was once more in motion, and
she too went gayly steaming down the river, her
less fortunate companions who were still aground
cheering her as she glided along the tortuous
channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was worth waiting some day or two
to see,&#8221; said Oscar, drawing a long breath. &#8220;Just
listen to that snorting calliope, playing &#8216;Home,
Sweet Home&#8217; as they go prancing down the Big
Muddy. I shall never forget her playing that
&#8216;Out of the Wilderness&#8217; as she tore out of those
shoals. It&#8217;s a pretty good tune, after all, and the
steam-organ is not so bad now that you hear it at
a distance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>STRANDED NEAR HOME.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was after dark, on a Saturday evening, when
the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; landed her passengers at the
levee, St. Louis. They should have been in the
city several hours earlier, and they had expected
to arrive by daylight. The lads marvelled much
at the sight of the muddy waters of the Missouri
running into the pure currents of the Mississippi,
twenty miles above St. Louis, the two streams
joining but not mingling, the yellow streak of the
Big Muddy remaining separate and distinct from
the flow of the Mississippi for a long distance below
the joining of the two. They had also found
new enjoyment in the sight of the great, many-storied
steamboats with which the view was now
diversified as they drew nearer the beautiful city
which had so long been the object of their hopes
and longings. They could not help thinking, as
they looked at the crowded levee, solid buildings,
and slender church spires, that all this was a
strange contrast to the lonely prairie and wide,
trackless spaces of their old home on the banks of
the distant Kansas stream. The Republican Fork
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
seemed to them like a far-off dream, it was so very
distant to them now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you young fellows going to stop in
St. Louis?&#8221; asked the pleasant-faced young man
from Baltimore.</p>
<p>The lads had scarcely thought of that, and here
was the city, the strange city in which they knew
nobody, in full sight. They exchanged looks of
dismay, Sandy&#8217;s face wearing an odd look of
amusement and apprehension mixed. Charlie
timidly asked what hotels were the best. The
young man from Baltimore named two or three
which he said were &#8220;first-class,&#8221; and Charlie
thought to himself that they must avoid those.
They had no money to pay for their lodging, no
baggage as security for their payment.</p>
<p>As soon as they could get away by themselves,
they held a council to determine what was to be
done. They had the business address of their
uncle, Oscar Bryant, of the firm of Bryant, Wilder
&amp; Co., wholesale dealers in agricultural implements,
Front Street. But they knew enough
about city life to know that it would be hopeless
to look for him in his store at night. It would be
nearly nine o&#8217;clock before they could reach any
hotel. What was to be done? Charlie was certain
that no hotel clerk would be willing to give
them board and lodging, penniless wanderers as
they were, with nothing but one small valise to
answer as luggage for the party. They could
have no money until they found their uncle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>Before they could make up their minds what to
do, or which way to turn, the boat had made her
landing and was blowing off steam at the levee.
The crowds of passengers, glad to escape from the
narrow limits of the steamer, were hurrying ashore.
The three homeless and houseless lads were carried
resistlessly along with the crowd. Charlie
regretted that they had not asked if they could
stay on the boat until Sunday morning. But
Sandy and Oscar both scouted such a confession
of their poverty. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; said Sandy, &#8220;it is
not likely that they would keep any passengers on
board here at the levee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride up? Free &#8217;bus to the Planters&#8217;!&#8221; cried
one of the runners on the levee, and before the
other two lads could collect their thoughts, the
energetic Sandy had drawn them into the omnibus,
and they were on their way to an uptown hotel.
When the driver had asked where their baggage
was, Sandy, who was ready to take command of
things, had airily answered that they would have
it sent up from the steamer. There were other
passengers in the &#8217;bus, and Charlie, anxious and
distressed, had no chance to remonstrate; they were
soon rattling and grinding over the pavements
of St. Louis. The novelty of the ride and the
glitter of the brightly lighted shops in which
crowds of people were doing their Saturday-night
buying, diverted their attention for a time. Then
the omnibus backed up before a handsome hotel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and numerous colored men came hurrying down
the steps of the grand entrance to wait upon the
new arrivals. With much ceremony and obsequiousness,
the three young travellers were ushered
into the office, where they wrote their names in
a big book, and were escorted to a large and elegant
room, in which were ample, even luxurious,
sleeping accommodations for the trio.</p>
<p>The colored porter assiduously brushed off the
clothing of the lads. &#8220;Baggage?&#8221; the clerk at
the desk had asked when they registered. &#8220;Baggage,
sah?&#8221; the waiter asked again, as he dusted
briskly the jackets of the three guests. Neither
Charlie nor Oscar had the heart to make reply
to this very natural question. It was Sandy who
said: &#8220;We will not have our baggage up from
the steamer to-night. We are going right on up
north.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Sandy tipped the expectant waiter
with the long-treasured silver quarter of a dollar,
Charlie fairly groaned, and sinking into a chair as
the door closed, said, &#8220;Our last quarter! Great
Scott, Sandy! are you crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy, seeing that there was no help for it,
put on a bold front, and insisted that they must
keep up appearances to the last. He would hunt
up Uncle Oscar&#8217;s place of abode in the city directory
after supper, and bright and early Sunday
morning he would go and see him. They would
be all right then. What use was that confounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
old quarter, anyhow? They might as well stand
well with the waiter. He might be useful to them.
Twenty-five cents would not pay their hotel bill;
it would not buy anything they needed in St.
Louis. The darky might as well have it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is one of the swellest and most expensive
hotels in the city,&#8221; cried Charlie, eyeing
the costly furniture and fittings of the room in
which they were lodged. &#8220;I just think that we
are travelling under false pretences, putting up at
an expensive house like this without a cent in our
pockets. Not one cent! What will you do, you
cheeky boy, if they ask us for our board in advance?
I have heard that they always do that
with travellers who have no baggage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what we will do,&#8221; said
Sandy, doggedly. &#8220;Suppose we wait until they
ask us. There&#8217;ll be time enough to decide when
we are dunned for our bill. I suppose the honestest
thing would be to own right up and tell the
whole truth. It&#8217;s nothing to be ashamed of. Lots
of people have to do that sort of thing when they
get into a tight place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m really afraid, Sandy, that they won&#8217;t
believe us,&#8221; said the practical Oscar. &#8220;The world
is full of swindlers as well as of honest fellows.
They might put us out as adventurers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not adventurers!&#8221; cried Sandy, indignantly.
&#8220;We are gentlemen when we are at home,
able to pay our debts. We are overtaken by an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
accident,&#8221; he added, chuckling to himself. &#8220;Distressed
gentlemen, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we might have gone to a cheaper place,&#8221;
moaned Charlie. &#8220;Here we are in the highest-priced
hotel in St. Louis. I know it, for I heard
that Baltimore chap say so. We might have put
up at some third-rate house, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is the third-rate house that asks you for
your baggage, and makes you pay in advance if
you don&#8217;t have any,&#8221; cried Sandy, triumphantly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that a high-toned hotel like this
duns people in advance for their board, especially
if it is a casual traveller, such as we are. Anyhow,
they haven&#8217;t dunned us yet, and when they
do, I&#8217;ll engage to see the party through, Master
Charlie; so you set your mind at rest.&#8221; As for
Charlie, he insisted that he would keep out of the
sight of the hotel clerk, until relief came in the
shape of money to pay their bill.</p>
<p>Oscar, who had been reading attentively a printed
card tacked to the door of the room, broke in with
the declaration that he was hungry, and that supper
was served until ten o&#8217;clock at night. The
others might talk all night, for all he cared; he
intended to have some supper. There was no use
arguing about the chances of being dunned for
their board; the best thing he could think of was
to have some board before he was asked to pay for
it. And he read out the list of hours for dinner,
breakfast, and supper from the card.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is merit in your suggestion,&#8221; said Charlie,
with a grim smile. &#8220;The dead-broke Boy
Settlers from the roaring Republican Fork will
descend to the banquet-hall.&#8221; Charlie was recovering
his spirits under Oscar&#8217;s cool and unconcerned
advice to have board before being in the way of
paying for it.</p>
<p>After supper, the lads, feeling more cheerful
than before, sauntered up to the clerk&#8217;s desk, and
inspected the directory of the city. They found
their uncle&#8217;s name and address, and it gave them
a gleam of pleasure to see his well-remembered
business card printed on the page opposite. Under
the street address was printed Mr. Bryant&#8217;s place
of residence, thus: &#8220;h. at Hyde Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Sandy, confidently, of
the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s out of the city a few miles. You
can ride out there in the stage. Only costs you a
quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a quarter! And the last quarter had gone
to the colored boy with the whisk-broom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a go!&#8221; said Sandy, for once a little cast
down. &#8220;We might walk it,&#8221; Oscar whispered, as
they moved away from the desk. But to this
Charlie, asserting the authority of an elder brother,
steadfastly objected. He knew his Uncle Oscar
better than the younger boys did. He remembered
that he was a very precise and dignified elderly
gentleman. He would be scandalized greatly if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
his three wandering nephews should come tramping
out to his handsome villa on a Sunday, like
three vagabonds, to borrow money enough to get
home to Dixon with. No; that was not to be
thought of. Charlie said he would pawn his watch
on Monday morning; he would walk the streets to
keep out of the way of the much-dreaded hotel
clerk; but, as for trudging out to his Uncle Oscar&#8217;s
on Sunday, he would not do it, nor should either
of the others stir a step. So they went to bed, and
slept as comfortably in their luxurious apartment
as if they had never known anything less handsome,
and had money in plenty to pay all demands
at sight.</p>
<p>It was a cloudy and chilly November Sunday to
which the boys awoke next day. The air was
piercingly raw, and the city looked dust-colored
and cheerless under the cold, gray sky. Breaking
their fast (Charlie keeping one eye on the hotel
office), they sallied forth to see the city. They
saw it all over, from one end to the other. They
walked and walked, and then went back to the
hotel; and after dinner, walked and walked again.
They hunted up their uncle&#8217;s store in one of the
deserted business streets of the city; and they
gazed at its exterior with a curious feeling of
relief. There was the sign on the prosperous-looking
outside of the building,&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Oscar G. Bryant
&amp; Co., Agricultural Implements.&#8221; There, at least,
was a gleam of comfort. The store was a real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
thing. Their uncle, little though they knew about
him, was a real man.</p>
<p>Then, as the evening twilight gathered, they
walked out to the borders of the suburb where he
lived. They did not venture into the avenue where
they had been told his house was, vaguely fearing
that he might meet and recognize them. As they
turned their steps towards the hotel, Oscar said:
&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky there are three of us to keep ourselves
in countenance. If that wasn&#8217;t the case, it would
be awfully lonely to think we were so near home,
and yet have gone ashore, hard and fast aground;
right in sight of port, as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parents of these boys had been born and
brought up near the seacoast of New England, and
not a few marine figures of speech were mingled
in the family talk. So Charlie took up the parable
and gloomily said: &#8220;We are as good as castaways
in this big ocean of a city, with never a soul to
throw us a spar or give us a hand. I never felt so
blue in all my life. Look at those children playing
in that dooryard. Pretty poor-looking children
they are; but they&#8217;ve got a home over their heads
to-night. We haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Charlie!&#8221; broke in Sandy; &#8220;why
will you always look on the dark side of things?
I know it&#8217;s real lonesome here in a strange city,
and away from our own folks. But they are not
so far away but what we can get to them after a
while. And we have got a roof over our heads for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
to-night, anyway; the Planters&#8217; is good enough for
me; if you want anything better, you will have to
get outside of St. Louis for it; and, what is more,
they are not going to dun us for our board bill
until after to-day. I&#8217;m clean beat out traipsing
around this town, and I give you two fellows
notice that I am not going to stir a step out of the
hotel to-night. Unless it is to go to church,&#8221; he
added by way of postscript.</p>
<p>They did go to church that night, after they had
had their supper. It was a big, comfortable, and
roomy church, and the lads were shown into a corner
pew under the gallery, where they were not
conspicuous. The music of choir and organ was
soothing and comforting. One of the tunes sung
was &#8220;Dundee,&#8221; and each boy thought of their singing
the song of &#8220;The Kansas Emigrants,&#8221; as the
warbling measures drifted down to them from the
organ-loft, lifting their hearts with thoughts that
the strangers about them knew nothing of. The
preacher&#8217;s text was &#8220;In my father&#8217;s house are
many mansions.&#8221; Then they looked at each
other again, as if to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s a nice text for
three homeless boys in a strange city.&#8221; But nobody
even so much as whispered.</p>
<p>Later on in the sermon, when the preacher
touched a tender chord in Oscar&#8217;s heart, alluding
to home and friends, and to those who wander far
from both, the lad, with a little moisture in his
eyes, turned to look at Sandy. He was fast asleep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
in his snug corner. Oscar made a motion to wake
him, but Charlie leaned over and said, &#8220;Leave the
poor boy alone. He&#8217;s tired with his long tramp
to-day.&#8221; When they went out after the service
was over, Oscar rallied Sandy on his sleeping in
church, and the lad replied: &#8220;I know it was bad
manners, but the last thing I heard the minister
say, was &#8216;Rest for the weary.&#8217; I thought that was
meant for me. Leastways, I found rest for the
weary right off, and I guess there was no harm
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Monday morning came sunshine and a
clear and bracing air. Even Charlie&#8217;s face wore a
cheerful look, the first that he had put on since
arriving in St. Louis, although now and again his
heart quaked as he heard the hotel porter&#8217;s voice
in the hall roaring out the time of departure for
the trains that now began to move from the city
in all directions. They had studied the railroad
advertisements and time-tables to some purpose,
and had discovered that they must cross to East
St. Louis, on the Illinois side of the Mississippi
River, and there take a train for the northern part
of the State, where Dixon is situated. But they
must first see their Uncle Oscar, borrow the needed
money from him, settle with the steamboat people
and the hotel, and then get to the railroad station
by eleven o&#8217;clock in the forenoon. It was a big
morning&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>They were at their uncle&#8217;s store before he arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
from his suburban home; and, while they waited,
they whisperingly discussed the question, Who
should ask for the money? Charlie was at first
disposed to put this duty on Sandy; but the other
two boys were very sure that it would not look
well for the youngest of the party to be the leader
on an occasion so important; and Charlie was
appointed spokesman.</p>
<p>Mr. Oscar Bryant came in. He was very much
surprised to see three strange lads drawn up in a
row to receive him. And he was still more taken
aback when he learned that they were his nephews,
on their way home from Kansas. He had heard
of his brother&#8217;s going out to Kansas, and he had
not approved of it at all. He was inclined to
think that, on the whole, it would be better for
Kansas to have slavery than to do without it. A
great many other people in St. Louis thought the
same way, at that time, although some of them
changed their minds later on.</p>
<p>Mr. Oscar Bryant was a tall, spruce-looking, and
severe man in appearance. His hair was gray and
brushed stiffly back from his forehead; and his
precise, thin, white whiskers were cut &#8220;just like a
minister&#8217;s,&#8221; as Sandy afterwards declared; and
when he said that going to Kansas to make it a
free State was simply the rankest kind of folly,
Charlie&#8217;s heart sunk, and he thought to himself
that the chance of borrowing money from their
stern-looking uncle was rather slim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t make any difference to you boys
whether slavery is voted up or down in Kansas, I
suppose,&#8221; he continued, less sternly. &#8220;You will
live to see the day when, if you live in Kansas,
you will own slaves and work them. You can
never clear up a wild country like that without
slave-labor, depend upon it. I know what I am
talking about.&#8221; And Uncle Oscar stroked his chin
in a self-satisfied way, as if he had settled the
whole Kansas-Nebraska question in his own manner
of thinking. Sandy&#8217;s brown cheeks flushed
and his eyes sparkled. He was about to burst out
with an indignant word, when Charlie, alarmed by
his small brother&#8217;s excited looks, blurted out their
troubles at once, in order to head off the protest
that he expected from Sandy. The lad was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? what&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the formal-looking
merchant. &#8220;Busted? And away from home?
Why, certainly, my lads. How much do you
need?&#8221; And he opened his pocket-book at once.
Greatly relieved, perhaps surprised, Charlie told
him that they thought that fifty dollars would pay
all their bills and get them back to Dixon. The
money was promptly handed over, and Charlie,
emboldened by this good nature, told his uncle
that they still owed for their passage down the
river from Leavenworth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did they really trust you three boys for
your passage-money? How did that happen?&#8221;
asked the merchant, with admiration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Charlie, as spokesman, explained that Sandy
had &#8220;sparred&#8221; their way for them; and when he
had told how Sandy still owed for a pack of cards,
and how it was his honest face and candid way of
doing things that had brought them thus far on
their homeward journey, Uncle Oscar, laughing
heartily and quite unbending from his formal and
dry way of talking, said, &#8220;Well done, my little
red-hot Abolitionist; you&#8217;ll get through this world,
I&#8217;ll be bound.&#8221; He bade the wanderers farewell
and goodspeed with much impressiveness and sent
messages of good-will to their parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you suppose Uncle Oscar knew I was
an Abolitionist?&#8221; demanded Sandy, as soon as
they were out of earshot. &#8220;I&#8217;m not an Abolitionist,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a free-State man; and that&#8217;s the
same thing,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;A free-State boy,&#8221;
added Oscar.</p>
<p>With a proud heart the cashier of the Boy Settlers
paid their bill at the hotel, and reclaimed
their valise from the porter, with whom they had
lodged it in the morning before going out. Then
they hurried to the levee, and, to their surprise,
found that the little steamer that conveyed passengers
across the river to the East St. Louis railway
station lay close alongside the &#8220;New Lucy.&#8221;
Their task of transferring the baggage was easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Sandy, you made the bargain with the
clerk to bring us down here on the security of our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
luggage; it&#8217;s nothing more than business-like that
you should pay him what we owe,&#8221; said Charlie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Charlie,&#8221; added Oscar, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s fair that Sandy, who has had the bother of
sparring our way for us, should have the proud
satisfaction of paying up all old scores.&#8221; So
Sandy, nothing loth, took the roll of bills and
marched bravely up to the clerk&#8217;s office and paid
the money due. The handsome clerk looked approvingly
at the boy, and said: &#8220;Found your
friends? Good boy! Well, I wish you good
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barkeeper said he had forgotten all about
the pack of cards that he had trusted Sandy with,
when the lad gave him the seventy-five cents due
him. &#8220;I can&#8217;t always keep account of these little
things,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t often trust anybody with cards
coming down the river, do you?&#8221; asked Sandy,
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaps,&#8221; said the barkeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do they always pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of &#8217;em does, and then ag&#8217;in, some of &#8217;em
doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the man, as with a yawn he
turned away to rearrange his bottles and glasses.</p>
<p>With the aid of a lounger on the landing, whom
they thought they could now afford to fee for a
quarter, the youngsters soon transferred their luggage
from the &#8220;New Lucy&#8221; to the little ferry-boat
near at hand. To their great pleasure, they found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
on board the pleasant-faced lady from Baltimore
and her party. She was apparently quite as pleased
to meet them, and she expressed her regret that
they were not going eastward on the train with
herself and sons. &#8220;We have had such a pleasant
trip down the river together,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you
are going back to Illinois? Will you return to
Kansas in the spring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot tell yet,&#8221; replied Charlie, modestly.
&#8220;That all depends upon how things look in the
spring, and what father and Uncle Aleck think
about it. We are free-State people, and we want
to see the Territory free, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pleasant-faced lady&#8217;s forehead was just a
little clouded when she said, &#8220;You will have your
labor lost, if you go to Kansas, then; for it will certainly
be a slave State.&#8221;</p>
<p>They soon were in the cars with their tickets for
Dixon bought, and, as Sandy exultingly declared,
paid for, and their baggage checked all the way
through. Then Sandy said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that pretty
lady from Baltimore is a Border Ruffian.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other two boys shouted with laughter, and
Oscar cried: &#8220;She&#8217;s no Border Ruffian. She&#8217;s only
pro-slavery; and so is Uncle Oscar and lots of others.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself to be so&ndash;&ndash;what
is it, Charlie? Intolerant, that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train was slowly moving from the rude shed
that was dignified by the name of railroad depot.
Looking back at the river with their heads out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
the windows, for the track lay at right angles with
the river bank, they could now see the last of the
noble stream on which they had taken their journey
downwards from &#8220;bleeding Kansas&#8221; by the Big
Muddy. They were nearing home, and their hearts
were all the lighter for the trials and troubles
through which they had so lately passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t cross the prairies as of old our fathers
crossed the sea, any more, do we, Charlie?&#8221; said
Oscar, as they caught their last glimpse of the
mighty Mississippi.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the elder lad. &#8220;We may not be
there to see it; but Kansas will be the homestead
of the free, for all that. Mind what I say.&#8221;</p>
